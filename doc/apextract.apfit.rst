  <UL>
  The two dimensional spectra within the defined apertures of the input
  images are fit by a model and new output images are created with either
  the model spectra, the difference between the input and model spectra,
  or the ratio of input and model spectra.  The type of output is
  selected by the parameter <I>fittype</I> which may have one of the
  values "<TT>fit</TT>", "<TT>difference</TT>", or "<TT>ratio</TT>".
  <P>
  Aperture definitions may be inherited from those of other images by
  specifying a reference image with the <B>references</B> parameter.
  Images in the reference list are matched with those in the
  input list in order.  If the reference image list is shorter than the
  number of input images, the last reference image is used for all
  remaining input images.  Thus, a single reference image may be given
  for all the input images or different reference images may be given for
  each input image.  The special reference name "<TT>last</TT>" may be used to
  select the last set apertures used in any of the <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  If an aperture reference image is not specified or no apertures are
  found for the specified reference image, previously defined apertures
  for the input image are sought in the aperture database.  Note that
  reference apertures supersede apertures for the input image.  If no
  apertures are defined they may be created automatically, the <I>find</I>
  option, or interactively in the aperture editor, if the
  <I>interactive</I> and <I>edit</I> options are set.
  <P>
  The functions performed by the task are selected by a set of flag
  parameters.  The functions are an automatic spectrum finding and
  aperture defining algorithm (see <B>apfind</B>) which is ignored if
  apertures are already defined, automatic recentering and resizing
  algorithms (see <B>aprecenter</B> and <B>apresize</B>), an interactive
  aperture editing function (see <B>apedit</B>), a spectrum position tracing
  and trace function fit (see <B>aptrace</B>), and the main function of
  this task, two dimensional model fitting.
  <P>
  Each function selection will produce a query for each input spectrum if
  the <I>interactive</I> parameter is set.  The queries are answered by
  "<TT>yes</TT>", "<TT>no</TT>", "<TT>YES</TT>", or "<TT>NO</TT>", where the upper case responses suppress
  the query for following images.  There are other queries associated
  with tracing which first ask whether the operation is to be done
  interactively and, if yes, lead to queries for each aperture.  If the
  <I>interactive</I> parameter is not set then aperture editing and
  interactive trace fitting are ignored.
  <P>
  The two dimensional spectrum model consists of a smooth two dimensional
  normalized profile multiplied by the variance weighted one dimensional
  spectrum.  The profile is computed by dividing the data within the aperture
  by the one dimensional spectrum, smoothing with either low order function
  fits parallel to the dispersion axis or a special two dimensional function
  as selected by the <I>pfit</I> parameter.  The smooth profile is then used
  to improve the spectrum estimate using variance weighting and to eliminate
  deviant or cosmic ray pixels by sigma tests.  The profile algorithm is
  described in detail in <B>approfiles</B> and the variance weighted spectrum
  is described in <B>apvariance</B>.
  <P>
  The process of determining the profile and variance weighted spectrum,
  and hence the two dimensional spectrum model, is identical to that used
  for variance weighted extraction of the one dimensional spectra in the
  tasks <B>apall</B> or <B>apsum</B>.  Most of the parameters of in this
  task are the same as those in the extraction tasks and so further
  information about them may be found in the descriptions of those tasks.
  <P>
  Because of the connection with variance weighted extraction and cleaning
  of one dimensional spectra, this task is useful as a diagnostic tool for
  understanding and evaluating the variance weighting algorithm.
  For example the "<TT>difference</TT>" image provides the residuals in a
  two dimensional visual form.
  <P>
  The "<TT>fit</TT>" output image does not include any background determination;
  i.e the fit is background subtracted.  Pixels outside the modeled
  spectra are set to zero.
  <P>
  The "<TT>difference</TT>" output image is simply the difference between the
  background subtracted "<TT>fit</TT>" and the data.  Thus the difference within
  the apertures should approximate the background and outside the
  apertures the difference will be identical with the input image.
  <P>
  The "<TT>ratio</TT>" output image does include any background in the model
  before taking the ratio of the data and model.  If a model pixel
  is less than the given <I>threshold</I> parameter the output ratio
  is set to one.  This is used to avoid division by zero and set a
  limit to noise in ratio image.  Outside of the apertures the ratio
  output pixels are set to one.
