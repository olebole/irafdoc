  There are three special words which may be used in place of an image

  option does not do any medianing or bad pixel checking; it is faster
  than fitting however.  Background subtraction also requires that the
  background fitting parameters are properly defined.  For the "<TT>average</TT>"

  <UL>
  <B>Apnoise</B> computes the noise sigma as a function of data value
  using the same profile model used for weighted extraction and
  cosmic ray cleanning.  In particular, the residuals used in computing the
  noise sigma are the same as those during cleanning.  By looking
  at the noise sigma as a function of data value as compared to that
  predicted by the noise model based on the read out noise and gain
  parameters one can then better refine these values for proper
  rejection of cosmic rays without rejection of valid data.
  So this task can be used to check or deduce these values and also
  to adjust them to include additional sources of error such as
  flat field noise and, especially, an additional source of noise due
  to the accuracy of the profile modeling.
  <P>
  The first part of this task follows the standard model of allowing
  one to define apertures by finding, recentering, editing, and
  tracing.  If one has previously defined apertures then these
  steps can be skipped.  Once the apertures are defined the apertures
  are internally extracted using the profile modeling (see <B>approfile</B>)
  with the optional background subtraction, cleanning, and choices of
  profile fitting algorithm, "<TT>fit1d</TT>" or "<TT>fit2d</TT>".  But rather than
  outputing the extracted spectrum as in <B>apsum</B> or <B>apall</B>
  or various functions of the data and profile model as in <B>apfit</B>,
  <B>apnormalize</B>, or <B>apflatten</B>, the task computes the
  residuals for all points in all apertures (essentially the same
  as the difference output of <B>apfit</B>) and determines the
  sigma (population corrected RMS) as a function of model data value
  in the specified bins.  The bins are defined by a minimum and
  maximum data value (found using <B>minmax</B>, <B>implot</B>, or
  <B>imexamine</B>) and the number of bins.
  <P>
  The noise sigma values, with their estimated uncertainties, are then
  plotted as a function of data numer.  A curve representing the specified
  read out noise and gain is also plotted.  The user then has the
  option of varying these two parameters with colon commands.  The
  aim of this is to find a noise model which either represents the
  measure noise sigmas or at least exceeds them so that only valid
  outliers such as cosmic rays will be rejected during cleanning.
  The interactive graphical mode only has this function.  The other
  keys and colon commands are the standard ones for redrawing, windowing,
  and quitting.
