  image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
  identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
  section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
  a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
  In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
  2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]

  coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical

  POLYPHOT computes the magnitude of objects in the IRAF image <I>image</I>
  inside a list of polygonal apertures whose vertices are listed in the text file
  <I>polygons</I> or are marked on the display interactively with the
  image cursor. The polygon centers  may be read from the polygon center
  file <I>coords</I> or set interactively with the image cursor.
  <P>
  The coordinates read from <I>coords</I> are assumed to be in coordinate
  system defined by <I>wcsin</I>. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>", "<TT>physical</TT>",
  and "<TT>world</TT>" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to
  the internal "<TT>logical</TT>" system is defined by the image coordinate system.
  The simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" pixel system. Users working on with
  image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent
  image must use the "<TT>tv</TT>" or "<TT>physical</TT>" input coordinate systems.
  Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
  must use the "<TT>world</TT>" coordinate system and may need to convert their
  equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.
  <P>
  The coordinates written to <I>output</I> are in the coordinate
  system defined by <I>wcsout</I>. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>",
  and "<TT>physical</TT>". The simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" system. Users
  wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
  image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
  image must use the "<TT>tv</TT>" or "<TT>physical</TT>" coordinate systems.
  <P>
  If <I>cache</I> is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
  are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If cacheing
  is enabled and POLYPHOT is run interactively the first measurement will appear
  to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
  is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because POLYPHOT
  is accessing memory not disk. The point of cacheing is to speed up random
  image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
  image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
  sparse cacheing may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
  present there is no point in enabling cacheing for images that are less than
  or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
  default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
  is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
  effect of cacheing in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
  of objects in the top and bottom halfs of the image are alternated.
  <P>
  In interactive mode the user may either define the list of objects to be
  measured interactively with the image cursor or create a polygon and polygon
  center list prior to running POLYPHOT. In either case the user may adjust
  the centering, sky fitting, and photometry algorithm parameters until a
  satisfactory fit is achieved and optionally store the final results
  in <I>output</I>. In batch mode the polygon and polygon centers are read
  from the text files <I>polygons</I> and <I>coords</I> or the image cursor
  parameter <I>icommands</I> can be redirected to a text file containing
  a list of cursor commands. In batch mode the current set of algorithm
  parameters is used.

  POLYPHOT computes the intersection of each image line with the line segments
  composing the polygon in order to determine the extent of the polygon. A one
  dimensional summation including a fractional approximation for the end pixels
  is performed over those regions of the image line which intersect the polygon.
  All the 1D summations are summed to give the total integral. The vertices of
  the polygon must be specified in order either clockwise or counterclockwise.

  Sum, area, and flux are the total number of counts including sky in the
  polygonal aperture, the area of the aperture in square pixels, and the total
  number of counts in the aperture excluding sky. Mag and merr are the magnitude
  and error in the magnitude in the aperture after subtracting the sky value
  (see below).
  <P>
  <PRE>
          flux = sum - area * msky
           mag = zmag - 2.5 * log10 (flux) + 2.5 * log10 (itime)
          merr = 1.0857 * error / flux
         error = sqrt (flux / epadu + area * stdev**2 +
                 area**2 * stdev**2 / nsky)

  Polygons and pid are the name of the polygons file and the polygon id
  respectively. Oldxmean, oldymean, xmean and ymean are the original and
  current average coordinates of the current polygon. Oldxmean and oldymean
  are the values in the polygons file or the values which correspond to the
  polygon drawn on the display. Xinit and yinit define the position to
  which the polygonal aperture was shifted. Xmean and ymean are generally
  identical to xcenter and ycenter and describe the position of the
  centered polygonal aperture. Maxrad is the maximum
  distance of a polygon vertex from the average of the vertices. Nver, xvertex
  and yvertex are the number of vertices and the coordinates of the vertices
  of the polygonal aperture.

  There are no restrictions on the shape of the polygon but the vertices
  must be listed or marked in order.
  <P>
  When marking the polygon on the display it is not necessary to close
  the polygon. When the user types q to quit the marking the program
  will automatically close the polygon.
  <P>
  It is currently the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
  image displayed on the display is the same as that specified by the image
  parameter.
  <P>
  Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.
  To enable graphics overlay on the image display, set the display
  parameter to "<TT>imdr</TT>", "<TT>imdg</TT>", "<TT>imdb</TT>", or "<TT>imdy</TT>" to get red, green,
  blue or yellow overlays and set the centerpars mkcenter switch to
  "<TT>yes</TT>", the fitskypars mksky switch to"<TT>yes</TT>", or the polypars mkpolygon
  switch to "<TT>yes</TT>". It may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image
  to get the overlays position correctly.
