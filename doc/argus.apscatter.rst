  <UL>
  The scattered light outside the apertures defining the two dimensional
  spectra is extracted, smoothed, and subtracted from each input image.  The
  approach is to first select the pixels outside the defined apertures
  and outside a buffer distance from the edge of any aperture at each
  point along the dispersion independently.  A one dimensional function
  is fit using the <B>icfit</B> package.  This fitting uses an iterative
  algorithm to further reject high values and thus fit the minima between
  the spectra.  (This even works reasonably well if no apertures are
  defined).  Because each fit is done independently the scattered light
  thus determined will not be smooth along the dispersion.  If desired
  each line along the dispersion in the scattered light surface may then
  be smoothed by again fitting a one dimensional function using the
  <B>icfit</B> package.  The final scattered light surface is then
  subtracted from the input image to form the output image.  The
  scattered light surface may be output if desired.
  <P>
  The reason for using two one dimensional fits as opposed to a surface fit
  is that the actual shape of the scattered light is often not easily modeled
  by a simple two dimensional function.  Also the one dimensional function
  fitting offers more flexibility in defining functions and options as
  provided by the <B>icfit</B> package.
  <P>
  The organization of the task is like the other tasks in the package
  which has options for defining apertures using a reference image,
  defining apertures through an automatic finding algorithm (see
  <B>apfind</B>), automatically recentering or resizing the apertures (see
  <B>aprecenter</B> and <B>apresize</B>), interactively editing the
  apertures (see <B>apedit</B>), and tracing the positions of the spectra
  as a function of dispersion position (see <B>aptrace</B>).  Though
  unlikely, the actual scattered light subtraction operation may be
  suppressed when the parameter <I>subtract</I> is no.  If the scattered
  light determination and fitting is done interactively (the
  <I>interactive</I> parameter set to yes) then the user is queried
  whether or not to do the fitting and subtraction for each image.  The
  responses are "<TT>yes</TT>", "<TT>no</TT>", "<TT>YES</TT>", or "<TT>NO</TT>", where the upper case
  queries suppress this query for the following images.  When the task is
  interactive there are further queries for each step of the operation
  which may also be answered both individually or collectively for all
  other input images using the four responses.
  <P>
  When the scattered light operation is done interactively the user may
  set the fitting parameters for the scattered light functions both
  across and along the dispersion interactively.  Initially the central
  line or column is used but after exiting (with <TT>'q'</TT>) a prompt is given
  for selecting additional lines or columns and for changing the buffer
  distance.  Note that the point of the interactive stage is to set the
  fitting parameters.  When the entire image is finally fit the last set
  of fitting parameters are used for all lines or columns.
  <P>
  The default fitting parameters are organized as separate parameter sets
  called <B>apscat1</B> for the first fits across the dispersion and
  <B>apscat2</B> for the second smoothing fits along the dispersion.
  Changes to these parameters made interactively during execution of
  this task are updated in the parameter sets.  The general idea for
  these parameters is that when fitting the pixels from between the
  apertures the iteration and rejection thresholds are set to eliminate
  high values while for smoothing along the dispersion a simple smooth
  function is all that is required.

  1.  To subtract the scattered light from a set of images to form a
  new set of images:
  <P>
  	cl&gt; apscatter raw* %raw%new%*
  <P>
  This example uses a substitution in the names from raw to new.
  By default this would be done interactively
  <P>
  2.  To subtract the scattered light in place and save the scattered light
  images:
  <P>
  	cl&gt; apscatter im* "<TT></TT>" scatter="s//im*"<TT> ref=im1 interact-
  <P>
  The prefix s is added to the original names for the scattered light.
  This operation is done noninteractively using a reference spectrum
  to define the apertures.
