  The <B>doargus</B> reduction task is specialized for scattered light
  subtraction, extraction, flat fielding, fiber throughput correction,
  wavelength calibration, and sky subtraction of <I>Argus</I> fiber spectra.
  It is a command language script which collects and combines the functions
  and parameters of many general purpose tasks to provide a single complete
  data reduction path.  The task provides a degree of guidance, automation,
  and record keeping necessary when dealing with the large amount of data
  generated by this multifiber instrument.

  <! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='throughput' Line='throughput = "" (optional)'>
  <DD>Throughput file or image.  If an image is specified, typically a blank sky
  observation, the total flux through each fiber is used to correct for fiber
  throughput.  If a file consisting of lines with the aperture number and
  relative throughput is specified then the fiber throughput will be
  corrected by those values.  If neither is specified but a flat field image
  is given it is used to compute the throughput.

  functions for each fiber apart from a possible zero point correction made
  with secondary shift spectra or arc calibration fibers in the object spectra.
  One fiber from the first spectrum is used to mark lines and set the dispersion
  function interactively and dispersion functions for all other fibers and

  <DD>The maximum data value which is not a cosmic ray.
  When cleaning cosmic rays and/or using variance weighted extraction
  very strong cosmic rays (pixel values much larger than the data) can
  cause these operations to behave poorly.  If a value other than INDEF
  is specified then all data pixels in excess of this value will be
  excluded and the algorithms will yield improved results.
  This applies only to the object spectra and not the flat field or arc
  spectra.  For more

  <DD>Number of fibers.  This number is used during the automatic definition of
  the apertures from the aperture reference spectrum.  It is best if this
  reflects the actual number of fibers which may be found in the aperture
  reference image.  Note that Argus fibers which are unassigned will still
  contain enough light for identification and the aperture identification
  table will be used to eliminate the unassigned fibers.  The interactive

  <DD>List of object and sky aperture numbers.  These are used to identify
  object and sky
  apertures for sky subtraction.  Note sky apertures may be identified as
  both object and sky if one wants to subtract the mean sky from the
  individual sky spectra.  Because the fibers typically alternate
  sky and object the default is to define the sky apertures by their
  aperture numbers and select both object and sky fibers for sky subtraction.

  <! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='scattered' Line='scattered = no (apscatter)'>
  <DD>Smooth and subtracted scattered light from the object and flat field
  images.  This operation consists of fitting independent smooth functions
  across the dispersion using data outside the fiber apertures and then
  smoothing the individual fits along the dispersion.  The initial
  flat field, or if none is given the aperture reference image, are
  done interactively to allow setting the fitting parameters.  All

  <! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='skyalign' Line='skyalign = no'>
  <DD>Align sky lines?  If yes then for the first object spectrum you are asked
  to mark one or more sky lines to use for alignment.  Then these lines will
  be found in all spectra and an average zeropoint shift computed and applied
  to the dispersion solution to align these lines.  Note that this assumes

  The <B>doargus</B> reduction task is specialized for scattered light
  subtraction, extraction, flat
  fielding, fiber throughput correction, wavelength calibration, and sky
  subtraction of <I>Argus</I> fiber spectra.  It is a
  command language script which collects and combines the functions and
  parameters of many general purpose tasks to provide a single, complete data
  reduction path.  The task provides a degree of guidance, automation, and
  record keeping necessary when dealing with the large amount of data
  generated by these multifiber instruments.
  <P>
  The general organization of the task is to do the interactive setup steps
  first using representative calibration data and then perform the majority
  of the reductions automatically, and possibly as a background process, with
  reference to the setup data.  In addition, the task determines which setup
  and processing operations have been completed in previous executions of the
  task and, contingent on the <I>redo</I> and <I>update</I> options, skip or
  repeat some or all the steps.
  <P>
  The description is divided into a quick usage outline followed by details
  of the parameters and algorithms.  The usage outline is provided as a
  checklist and a refresher for those familiar with this task and the
  component tasks.  It presents only the default or recommended usage for
  Argus since there are many variations possible.  Because <B>doargus</B>
  combines many separate, general purpose tasks the description given here
  refers to these tasks and leaves some of the details to their help

  generally not done at this stage but as part of <B>doargus</B>.
  If flat fielding is done as part of the basic CCD processing then
  a flattened flat field, blank sky observation, or throughput file
  should still be created for applying fiber throughput corrections.
  <P>
  The task <B>doargus</B> uses several types of calibration spectra.  These
  are flat fields, blank sky flat fields, comparison lamp spectra, and auxiliary
  mercury line (from the dome lights) or sky line spectra.  The flat field,
  throughput image or file, and auxiliary emission line spectra are optional.
  If a flat field is used then the sky flat
  or throughput file is optional assuming the flat field has the same fiber
  iillumination.  It is legal to specify only a throughput image or file and
  leave the flat field blank in order to simply apply a throughput
  correction.  Because only the total counts through each fiber are used from
  a throughput image, sky flat exposures need not be of high signal per
  pixel.
  <P>
  There are two types of dispersion calibration methods.  One is to take arc
  calibration exposures through all fibers periodically and apply the
  dispersion function derived from one or interpolated between pairs to the
  object fibers.  This is the usual method with Argus.
  A second (uncommon) method is to use <I>auxiliary
  line spectra</I> such as lines in the dome lights or sky lines to monitor
  shifts relative to a few actual arc exposures.  The main reason to do this
  is if taking arc exposures through all fibers is inconvenient.
  <P>
  The assignment of arc or auxiliary line calibration exposures to object
  exposures is generally done by selecting the nearest in time and
  interpolating.  There are other options possible which are described under
  the task <B>refspectra</B>.  The most general option is to define a table
  giving the object image name and the one or two arc spectra to be assigned
  to that object.  That file is called an <I>arc assignment table</I> and it
  is one of the optional setup files which can used with <B>doargus</B>.
  <P>
  The first step in the processing is identifying the spectra in the images.
  The default method is to use the fact that object and sky fibers alternate
  and assign sequential numbers to the fibers so that the sky fibers are the
  even aperture numbers and the object fibers are the odd aperture numbers.
  In this case the beam numbers are not used (and are the same as the
  aperture numbers) and there are no object identifications associated with the
  spectra.
  <P>
  A very useful, optional, setup parameter is an <I>aperture identification
  table</I>.  The table contains information about the fiber assignments
  including object titles.  The table is either a text file or an image
  containing the keywords SLFIB.  An aperture identification file contains
  lines consisting of an aperture number, a beam number, and an object
  identification.  In an image the SLFIB keywords contain the aperture
  number, the beam numbers, optional right ascension and declination, and a
  title.  The aperture identification information must be in the same order
  as the fibers in the image.  The aperture number may be any unique number
  but it is recommended that the normal sequential fiber numbers be used.
  The beam number may be used to flag object or sky spectra or simply be the
  same as the aperture number.  The object identifications are optional but
  it is good practice to include them so that the data will contain the
  object information independent of other records.  Figure 1 shows an example
  of a file for a configuration called LMC123.
  <P>

  Note the identification of the sky fibers with beam number 0 and the
  object fibers with 1.  Any broken fibers should be included and
  identified by a different beam number, say beam number -1, to give the
  automatic spectrum finding operation the best chance to make the
  correct identifications.  Naturally the identification table will vary
  for each configuration.
  Additional information about the aperture identification
  table may be found in the description of the task <B>apfind</B>.
  <P>
  In more recent Argus data the fiber information is included in the
  image header under the keywords SLFIB.  In this case you don't need
  to prepare a file and simply specify the name of an image, typically
  the same as the aperture reference image, for the aperture identification
  table.
  <P>
  The final reduced spectra are recorded in two or three dimensional IRAF
  images.  The images have the same name as the original images with an added
  "<TT>.ms</TT>" extension.  Each line in the reduced image is a one dimensional
  spectrum with associated aperture, wavelength, and identification
  information.  When the <I>extras</I> parameter is set the lines in the
  third dimension contain additional information (see
  <B>apsum</B> for further details).  These spectral formats are accepted by the
  one dimensional spectroscopy tools such as the plotting tasks <B>splot</B>
  and <B>specplot</B>.  The special task <B>scopy</B> may be used to extract
  specific apertures or to change format to individual one dimensional
  images.
  <P>
  <B>Package Parameters</B>
  <P>
  The <B>argus</B> package parameters set parameters affecting all the
  tasks in the package.
  The dispersion axis parameter defines the image axis along which the
  dispersion runs.  This is used if the image header doesn't define the
  dispersion axis with the DISPAXIS keyword.
  The observatory parameter is only required
  for data taken with fiber instruments other than Argus.
  The spectrum interpolation type might be changed to "<TT>sinc</TT>" but
  with the cautions given in <B>onedspec.package</B>.
  The other parameters define the standard I/O functions.
  The verbose parameter selects whether to print everything which goes
  into the log file on the terminal.  It is useful for monitoring
  what the <B>doargus</B> task does.  The log and plot files are useful for
  keeping a record of the processing.  A log file is highly recommended.
  A plot file provides a record of apertures, traces, and extracted spectra
  but can become quite large.
  The plotfile is most conveniently viewed and printed with <B>gkimosaic</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Processing Parameters</B>
  <P>
  The list of objects and arcs can be @ files if desired.  The aperture
  reference spectrum is usually the same as the flat field spectrum though it
  could be any exposure with enough signal to accurately define the positions
  and trace the spectra.  The first list of arcs are the standard Th-Ar or
  HeNeAr comparison arc spectra (they must all be of the same type).  The
  second list of arcs are the auxiliary emission line exposures mentioned
  previously.
  <P>
  The detector read out noise and gain are used for cleaning and variance
  (optimal) extraction.
  The dispersion axis defines the wavelength direction of spectra in
  the image if not defined in the image header by the keyword DISPAXIS.  The
  width and separation parameters define the dimensions (in pixels) of the
  spectra (fiber profile) across the dispersion.  The width parameter
  primarily affects the centering.  The maximum separation parameter is
  important if missing spectra are to
  be correctly skipped.  The number of fibers can be left at the default
  and the task will try to account for unassigned or missing fibers.
  However, this may lead to occasional incorrect
  identifications so it is recommended that only the true number of
  fibers be specified.  The aperture identification table was described
  earlier.
  <P>
  The approximate central wavelength and dispersion are used for the
  automatic identification of the arc reference.  They may be specified
  as image header keywords or values.  The INDEF values search the
  entire range of the coordinate reference file but the automatic
  line identification algorithm works much better and faster if
  approximate values are given.
  <P>
  The task needs to know which fibers are object and which are sky
  if sky subtraction is to be done.  One could explicitly
  give the aperture numbers but the recommended way is to use the default
  of selecting every second fiber as sky.  If no list of aperture or beam
  numbers is given
  then all apertures or beam numbers are selected.  Sky subtracted sky
  spectra are useful for evaluating the sky subtraction.  Since only
  the spectra identified as objects are sky subtracted one can exclude
  fibers from the sky subtraction.  For example, to eliminate the sky
  spectra from the final results the <I>objaps</I> parameter could be
  set to "<TT>1x2</TT>".  All other fibers will remain in the extracted spectra
  but will not be sky subtracted.
  <P>
  The next set of parameters select the processing steps and options.  The
  scattered light option allows fitting and subtracting a scattered light
  surface from the input object and flat field.  If there is significant
  scattered light which is not subtracted the fiber throughput correction
  will not be accurate.  The
  flat fitting option allows fitting and removing the overall shape of the
  flat field spectra while preserving the pixel-to-pixel response
  corrections.  This is useful for maintaining the approximate object count
  levels and not introducing the reciprocal of the flat field spectrum into
  the object spectra.  The <I>clean</I> option invokes a profile fitting and
  deviant point rejection algorithm as well as a variance weighting of points
  in the aperture.  These options require knowing the effective (i.e.
  accounting for any image combining) read out noise and gain.  For a
  discussion of cleaning and variance weighted extraction see
  <B>apvariance</B> and <B>approfiles</B>.
  <P>
  The dispersion correction option selects whether to extract arc spectra,
  determine a dispersion function, assign them to the object spectra, and,
  possibly, resample the spectra to a linear (or log-linear) wavelength
  scale.  If simultaneous arc fibers are defined there is an option to delete
  them from the final spectra when they are no longer needed.
  <P>
  The sky alignment option allows applying a zeropoint dispersion shift
  to all fibers based on one or more sky lines.  This requires all fibers
  to have the sky lines visible.  When there are sky lines this will
  improve the sky subtraction if there is a systematic error in the
  fiber iillumination between the sky and the arc calibration.
  <P>
  The sky subtraction option selects whether to combine the sky fiber spectra
  and subtract this sky from the object fiber spectra.  It is also possible
  to subtract the sky and object fibers by pairs.  <I>Dispersion
  correction and sky subtraction are independent operations.</I>  This means
  that if dispersion correction is not done then the sky subtraction will be
  done with respect to pixel coordinates.  This might be desirable in some
  quick look cases though it is incorrect for final reductions.
  <P>
  The sky subtraction option has two additional options.  The individual sky
  spectra may be examined and contaminated spectra deleted interactively
  before combining.  This can be a useful feature in crowded regions.  The
  final combined sky spectrum (or individual skys if subtracting by
  pairs) may be saved for later inspection in an image
  with the spectrum name prefixed by <B>sky</B>.
  <P>
  After a spectrum has been processed it is possible to examine the results
  interactively using the <B>splot</B> tasks.  This option has a query which
  may be turned off with "<TT>YES</TT>" or "<TT>NO</TT>" if there are multiple spectra to be
  processed.
  <P>
  Generally once a spectrum has been processed it will not be reprocessed if
  specified as an input spectrum.  However, changes to the underlying
  calibration data can cause such spectra to be reprocessed if the
  <I>update</I> flag is set.  The changes which will cause an update are a new
  aperture identification table, a new reference image, new flat fields, and a
  new arc reference.  If all input spectra are to be processed regardless of
  previous processing the <I>redo</I> flag may be used.  Note that
  reprocessing clobbers the previously processed output spectra.
  <P>
  The <I>batch</I> processing option allows object spectra to be processed as
  a background or batch job.  This will only occur if sky spectra editing and
  <B>splot</B> review (interactive operations) are turned off, either when the
  task is run or by responding with "<TT>NO</TT>" to the queries during processing.
  <P>
  The <I>listonly</I> option prints a summary of the processing steps which
  will be performed on the input spectra without actually doing anything.
  This is useful for verifying which spectra will be affected if the input
  list contains previously processed spectra.  The listing does not include
  any arc spectra which may be extracted to dispersion calibrate an object
  spectrum.
  <P>
  The last parameter (excluding the task mode parameter) points to another
  parameter set for the algorithm parameters.  The way <B>doargus</B> works
  this may not have any value and the parameter set <B>params</B> is always
  used.  The algorithm parameters are discussed further in the next section.
  <P>
  <B>Algorithms and Algorithm Parameters</B>
  <P>
  This section summarizes the various algorithms used by the <B>doargus</B>
  task and the parameters which control and modify the algorithms.  The
  algorithm parameters available to the user are collected in the parameter
  set <B>params</B>.  These parameters are taken from the various general
  purpose tasks used by the <B>doargus</B> processing task.  Additional
  information about these parameters and algorithms may be found in the help
  for the actual task executed.  These tasks are identified in the parameter
  section listing in parenthesis.  The aim of this parameter set organization
  is to collect all the algorithm parameters in one place separate from the
  processing parameters and include only those which are relevant for
  Argus.  The parameter values can be changed from the
  defaults by using the parameter editor,
  <PRE>
  <P>
  	cl&gt; epar params
  <P>
  </PRE>
  or simple typing <I>params</I>.  The parameter editor can also be
  entered when editing the <B>doargus</B> parameters by typing <I>:e
  params</I> or simply <I>:e</I> if positioned at the <I>params</I>
  parameter.
  <P>
  <B>Extraction</B>
  <P>
  The identification of the spectra in the two dimensional images and their
  scattered light subtraction and extraction to one dimensional spectra
  in multispec format is accomplished
  using the tasks from the <B>apextract</B> package.  The first parameters
  through <I>nsubaps</I> control the extractions.
  <P>
  The dispersion line is that used for finding the spectra, for plotting in
  the aperture editor, and as the starting point for tracing.  The default
  value of <B>INDEF</B> selects the middle of the image.  The aperture
  finding, adjusting, editing, and tracing operations also allow summing a
  number of dispersion lines to improve the signal.  The number of lines is
  set by the <I>nsum</I> parameter.
  <P>
  The order parameter defines whether the order of the aperture
  identifications in the aperture identification table (or the default
  sequential numbers if no table is used) is in the same sense as the image
  coordinates (increasing) or the opposite sense (decreasing).  If the
  aperture identifications turn out to be opposite to what is desired when
  viewed in the aperture editing graph then simply change this parameter.
  <P>
  The basic data output by the spectral extraction routines are the one
  dimensional spectra.  Additional information may be output when the
  <I>extras</I> option is selected and the cleaning or variance weighting
  options are also selected.  In this case a three dimensional image is
  produced with the first element of the third dimension being the cleaned
  and/or weighted spectra, the second element being the uncleaned and
  unweighted spectra, and the third element being an estimate of the sigma
  of each pixel in the extracted spectrum.  Currently the sigma data is not
  used by any other tasks and is only for reference.
  <P>
  The initial step of finding the fiber spectra in the aperture reference
  image consists of identifying the peaks in a cut across the dispersion,
  eliminating those which are closer to each other than the <I>minsep</I>
  distance, and then keeping the specified <I>nfibers</I> highest peaks.  The
  centers of the profiles are determined using the <B>center1d</B> algorithm
  which uses the <I>width</I> parameter.
  <P>
  Apertures are then assigned to each spectrum.  The initial edges of the
  aperture relative to the center are defined by the <I>lower</I> and
  <I>upper</I> parameters.
  The initial apertures are the same for all spectra but they can each be
  automatically resized.  The automatic resizing sets the aperture limits
  at a fraction of the peak relative to the interfiber minimum.
  The default <I>ylevel</I> is to resize the apertures to 5% of the peak.
  See the description for the task <B>apresize</B> for further details.
  <P>
  The user is given the opportunity to graphically review and adjust the
  aperture definitions.  This is recommended
  and it is fundamentally important that the correct aperture/beam numbers
  be associated with the proper fibers;
  otherwise the spectrum
  identifications will not be for the objects they say.  An important command in
  this regard is the <TT>'o'</TT> key which allows reordering the identifications.
  This is required if the first
  fiber is actually missing since the initial assignment begins with the
  first spectrum found.  The
  aperture editor is a very powerful tool and is described in detail as
  <B>apedit</B>.
  <P>
  The next set of parameters control the tracing and function fitting of the
  aperture reference positions along the dispersion direction.  The position
  of a spectrum across the dispersion is determined by the centering
  algorithm (see <B>center1d</B>) at a series of evenly spaced steps, given by
  the parameter <I>t_step</I>, along the dispersion.  The step size should be
  fine enough to follow position changes but it is not necessary to measure
  every point.  The fitted points may jump around a little bit due to noise
  and cosmic rays even when summing a number of lines.  Thus, a smooth
  function is fit.  The function type, order, and iterative rejection of
  deviant points is controlled by the other trace parameters.  For more
  discussion consult the help pages for <B>aptrace</B> and <B>icfit</B>.  The
  default is to fit a cubic spline of three pieces with a single iteration of
  3 sigma rejection.
  <P>
  The actual extraction of the spectra by summing across the aperture at each
  point along the dispersion is controlled by the next set of parameters.
  The default extraction simply sums the pixels using partial pixels at the
  ends.  The options allow selection of a weighted sum based on a Poisson
  variance model using the <I>readnoise</I> and <I>gain</I> detector
  parameters.  Note that if the <I>clean</I> option is selected the variance
  weighted extraction is used regardless of the <I>weights</I> parameter.  The
  sigma thresholds for cleaning are also set in the <B>params</B> parameters.
  For more on the variance weighted extraction and cleaning see
  <B>apvariance</B> and <B>approfiles</B> as well as <B>apsum</B>.
  <P>
  The last parameter, <I>nsubaps</I>, is used only in special cases when it is
  desired to subdivide the fiber profiles into subapertures prior to
  dispersion correction.  After dispersion correction the subapertures are
  then added together.  The purpose of this is to correct for wavelength
  shifts across a fiber.
  <P>
  <B>Scattered Light Subtraction</B>
  <P>
  Scattered light may be subtracted from the input two dimensional image as
  the first step.  This is done using the algorithm described in
  <B>apscatter</B>.  This can be important if there is significant scattered
  light since the flat field/throughput correction will otherwise be
  incorrect.  The algorithm consists of fitting a function to the data
  outside the defined apertures by a specified <I>buffer</I> at each line or
  column across the dispersion.  The function fitting parameters are the same
  at each line.  Because the fitted functions are independent at each line or
  column a second set of one dimensional functions are fit parallel to the
  dispersion using the evaluated fit values from the cross-dispersion step.
  This produces a smooth scattered light surface which is finally subtracted
  from the input image.  Again the function fitting parameters are the
  same at each line or column though they may be different than the parameters
  used to fit across the dispersion.
  <P>
  The first time the task is run with a particular flat field (or aperture
  reference image if no flat field is used) the scattered light fitting
  parameters are set interactively using that image.  The interactive step
  selects a particular line or column upon which the fitting is done
  interactively with the <B>icfit</B> commands.  A query is first issued
  which allows skipping this interactive stage.  Note that the interactive
  fitting is only for defining the fitting functions and orders.  When
  the graphical <B>icfit</B> fitting is exited (with <TT>'q'</TT>) there is a second prompt
  allowing you to change the buffer distance (in the first cross-dispersion
  stage) from the apertures, change the line/column, or finally quit.
  <P>
  The initial fitting parameters and the final set parameters are recorded
  in the <B>apscat1</B> and <B>apscat2</B> hidden parameter sets.  These
  parameters are then used automatically for every subsequent image
  which is scattered light corrected.
  <P>
  The scattered light subtraction modifies the input 2D images.  To preserve
  the original data a copy of the original image is made with the same
  root name and the word "<TT>noscat</TT>" appended.  The scattered light subtracted
  images will have the header keyword "<TT>APSCATTE</TT>" which is how the task
  avoids repeating the scattered light subtraction during any reprocessing.
  However if the <I>redo</I> option is selected the scattered light subtraction
  will also be redone by first restoring the "<TT>noscat</TT>" images to the original
  input names.
  <P>
  <B>Flat Field and Fiber Throughput Corrections</B>
  <P>
  Flat field corrections may be made during the basic CCD processing; i.e.
  direct division by the two dimensional flat field observation.  In that
  case do not specify a flat field spectrum; use the null string "<TT></TT>".  The
  <B>doargus</B> task provides an alternative flat field response correction
  based on division of the extracted object spectra by the extracted flat field
  spectra.  A discussion of the theory and merits of flat fielding directly
  verses using the extracted spectra will not be made here.  The
  <B>doargus</B> flat fielding algorithm is the <I>recommended</I> method for
  flat fielding since it works well and is not subject to the many problems
  involved in two dimensional flat fielding.
  <P>
  In addition to correcting for pixel-to-pixel response the flat field step
  also corrects for differences in the fiber throughput.  Thus, even if the
  pixel-to-pixel flat field corrections have been made in some other way it
  is desirable to use a sky or dome flat observation for determining a fiber
  throughput correction.  Alternatively, a separately derived throughput
  file may be specified.  This file consists of the aperture numbers
  (the same as used for the aperture reference) and relative throughput
  numbers.
  <P>
  The first step is extraction of the flat field spectrum, if specified,
  using the reference apertures.  Only one flat field is allowed so if
  multiple flat fields are required the data must be reduced in groups.
  After extraction one or more corrections are applied.  If the <I>fitflat</I>
  option is selected (the default) the extracted flat field spectra are
  averaged together and a smooth function is fit.  The default fitting
  function and order are given by the parameters <I>f_function</I> and
  <I>f_order</I>.  If the parameter <I>f_interactive</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" then the
  fitting is done interactively using the <B>fit1d</B> task which uses the
  <B>icfit</B> interactive fitting commands.
  <P>
  The fitted function is divided into the individual flat field spectra to
  remove the basic shape of the spectrum while maintaining the relative
  individual pixel responses and any fiber to fiber differences.  This step
  avoids introducing the flat field spectrum shape into the object spectra
  and closely preserves the object counts.
  <P>
  If a throughput image is available (an observation of blank sky
  usually at twilight) it is extracted.  If no flat field is used the average
  signal through each fiber is computed and this becomes the response
  normalization function.  Note that a dome flat may be used in place of a
  sky in the sky flat field parameter for producing throughput only
  corrections.  If a flat field is specified then each sky spectrum is
  divided by the appropriate flat field spectrum.  The total counts through
  each fiber are multiplied into the flat field spectrum thus making the sky
  throughput of each fiber the same.  This correction is important if the
  iillumination of the fibers differs between the flat field source and the
  sky.  Since only the total counts are required the sky or dome flat field
  spectra need not be particularly strong though care must be taken to avoid
  objects.
  <P>
  Instead of a sky flat or other throughput image a separately derived
  throughput file may be used.  It may be used with or without a
  flat field.
  <P>
  The final step is to normalize the flat field spectra by the mean counts of
  all the fibers.  This normalization step is simply to preserve the average
  counts of the extracted object and arc spectra after division by the
  response spectra.  The final relative throughput values are recorded in the
  log and possibly printed on the terminal.
  <P>
  These flat field response steps and algorithm are available as a separate
  task called <B>msresp1d</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Dispersion Correction</B>
  <P>
  Dispersion corrections are applied to the extracted spectra if the
  <B>dispcor</B> parameter is set.  This can be a complicated process which
  the <B>doargus</B> task tries to simplify for you.  There are three basic
  steps involved; determining the dispersion functions relating pixel
  position to wavelength, assigning the appropriate dispersion function to a
  particular observation, and resampling the spectra to evenly spaced pixels
  in wavelength.
  <P>
  The comparison arc spectra are used to define dispersion functions for the
  fibers using the tasks <B>autoidentify</B> and <B>reidentify</B>.  The
  interactive <B>autoidentify</B> task is only used on the central fiber of the
  first arc spectrum to define the basic reference dispersion solution from
  which all other fibers and arc spectra are automatically derived using
  <B>reidentify</B>. <B>Autoidentify</B> attempts to automatically identify
  the arc lines using the <I>crval</I> and <I>cdelt</I> parameters.  Whether
  or not it is successful the user is presented with the interactive
  identification graph.  The automatic identifications can be reviewed and a
  new solution or corrections to the automatic solution may be performed.
  <P>
  The set of arc dispersion function parameters are from <B>autoidentify</B> and
  <B>reidentify</B>.  The parameters define a line list for use in
  automatically assigning wavelengths to arc lines, a parameter controlling
  the width of the centering window (which should match the base line
  widths), the dispersion function type and order, parameters to exclude bad
  lines from function fits, and parameters defining whether to refit the
  dispersion function, as opposed to simply determining a zero point shift,
  and the addition of new lines from the line list when reidentifying
  additional arc spectra.  The defaults should generally be adequate and the
  dispersion function fitting parameters may be altered interactively.  One
  should consult the help for the two tasks for additional details of these
  parameters and the operation of <B>autoidentify</B>.
  <P>
  Generally, taking a number of comparison arc lamp exposures interspersed
  with the program spectra is sufficient to accurately dispersion calibrate
  Argus spectra.  Dispersion functions are
  determined independently for each fiber of each arc image and then assigned
  to the matching fibers in the program object observations.  The assignment
  consists of selecting one or two arc images to calibrate each object
  image.
  <P>
  However, there is another calibration option which may be of interest.
  This option uses auxiliary line spectra, such as from dome lights or night
  sky lines, to monitor wavelength zero point shifts which are added to the
  basic dispersion function derived from a single reference arc.  Initially
  one of the auxiliary fiber spectra is plotted interactively by
  <B>identify</B> with the reference dispersion function for the appropriate
  fiber.  The user marks one or more lines which will be used to compute zero
  point wavelength shifts in the dispersion functions automatically.  In this
  case it is auxiliary arc images which are assigned to particular objects.
  <P>
  The arc or auxiliary line image assignments may be done either explicitly with an arc assignment
  table (parameter <I>arctable</I>) or based on a header parameter.  The task
  used is <B>refspectra</B> and the user should consult this task if the
  default behavior is not what is desired.  The default is to interpolate
  linearly between the nearest arcs based on the Julian date (corrected to
  the middle of the exposure).  The Julian date and a local Julian day number
  (the day number at local noon) are computed automatically by the task
  <B>setjd</B> and recorded in the image headers under the keywords JD and
  LJD.  In addition the universal time at the middle of the exposure, keyword
  UTMIDDLE, is computed by the task <B>setairmass</B> and this may also be used
  for ordering the arc and object observations.
  <P>
  An optional step is to use sky lines in the spectra to compute a zeropoint
  dispersion shift that will align the sky lines.  This may improve sky
  subtraction if the iillumination is not the same between the arc calibration
  and the sky.  When selected the object spectrum is dispersion corrected
  using a non-linear dispersion function to avoid resampling the spectrum.
  The sky lines are then reidentified in wavelength space from a template
  list of sky lines.  The mean shift in the lines for each fiber relative to
  the template in that fiber is computed to give the zeropoint shift.  The
  database file is created when the first object is extracted.  You are asked
  to mark the sky lines in one fiber and then the lines are automatically
  reidentified in all other fibers.  Note that this technique requires the
  sky lines be found in all fibers.
  <P>
  The last step of dispersion correction (resampling the spectrum to evenly
  spaced pixels in wavelength) is optional and relatively straightforward.
  If the <I>linearize</I> parameter is no then the spectra are not resampled
  and the nonlinear dispersion information is recorded in the image header.
  Other IRAF tasks (the coordinate description is specific to IRAF) will use
  this information whenever wavelengths are needed.  If linearizing is
  selected a linear dispersion relation, either linear in the wavelength or
  the log of the wavelength, is defined once and applied to every extracted
  spectrum.  The resampling algorithm  parameters allow selecting the
  interpolation function type, whether to conserve flux per pixel by
  integrating across the extent of the final pixel, and whether to linearize
  to equal linear or logarithmic intervals.  The latter may be appropriate
  for radial velocity studies.  The default is to use a fifth order
  polynomial for interpolation, to conserve flux, and to not use logarithmic
  wavelength bins.  These parameters are described fully in the help for the
  task <B>dispcor</B> which performs the correction.  The interpolation
  function options and the nonlinear dispersion coordinate system is
  described in the help topic <B>onedspec.package</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Sky Subtraction</B>
  <P>
  Sky subtraction is selected with the <I>skysubtract</I> processing option.
  The sky spectra are selected by their aperture and beam numbers.
  If the <I>skyedit</I>
  option is selected the sky spectra are plotted using the task
  <B>specplot</B>.  By default they are superposed to allow identifying
  spectra with unusually high signal due to object contamination.  To
  eliminate a sky spectrum from consideration point at it with the cursor and
  type <TT>'d'</TT>.  The last deleted spectrum may be undeleted with <TT>'e'</TT>.  This
  allows recovery of incorrect or accidental deletions.
  <P>
  If the combining option is "<TT>none</TT>" then the sky and object fibers are
  paired and one sky is subtracted from one object and the saved sky will
  be the individual sky fiber spectra.
  <P>
  However, the usual
  case is to combine the individual skys into a single master sky spectrum
  which is then subtracted from each object spectrum.
  The sky combining algorithm parameters define how the individual sky fiber
  spectra, after interactive editing, are combined before subtraction from
  the object fibers.  The goals of combining are to reduce noise, eliminate
  cosmic-rays, and eliminate fibers with inadvertent objects.  The common
  methods for doing this to use a median and/or a special sigma clipping
  algorithm (see <B>scombine</B> for details).  The scale
  parameter determines whether the individual skys are first scaled to a
  common mode.  The scaling should be used if the throughput is uncertain,
  but in that case you probably did the wrong thing in the throughput
  correction.  If the sky subtraction is done interactively, i.e. with the
  <I>skyedit</I> option selected, then after selecting the spectra to be
  combined a query is made for the combining algorithm.  This allows
  modifying the default algorithm based on the number of sky spectra
  selected since the "<TT>avsigclip</TT>" rejection algorithm requires at least
  three spectra.
  <P>
  The combined sky spectrum is subtracted from only those spectra specified
  by the object aperture and beam numbers.  Other spectra
  are retained unchanged.  One may include the sky spectra as
  object spectra to produce residual sky spectra for analysis.  The combined
  master sky spectra may be saved if the <I>saveskys</I> parameter is set.
  The saved sky is given the name of the object spectrum with the prefix
  "<TT>sky</TT>".
