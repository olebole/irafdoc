  <H3>Description</H3>

  <UL>
  This task creates or modifies images with readout noise, poisson noise,
  and cosmic ray events.  New images are created with the specified
  dimensions and real datatype.  Existing images may be modified in place
  or new images may be created.
  <P>
  If a new image is created it is has the mean level given by the parameter
  <I>background</I>.  With no noise and no cosmic rays this task can be used to
  create images of constant background value.  For existing images the
  background is added before computing any noise.  To add noise to an
  existing image without modifying the mean counts set the background
  to zero.
  <P>
  For new images a set of header keywords may be added by specifying an
  image or data file with the <I>header</I> parameter (see also <B>mkheader</B>).
  If a data file is specified lines beginning with FITS keywords are
  entered in the image header.  Leading whitespace is ignored and any
  lines beginning with words having lowercase and nonvalid FITS keyword
  characters are ignored.  In addition to this optional header,
  keywords, parameters for the gain and read noise are defined.
  Finally, comments may be added to the image header recording the task
  parameters and any information from the cosmic ray file which are not
  cosmic ray definitions.
  <P>
  Poisson photon noise is generated by setting the <I>poisson</I> parameter.
  For new images the input data value is the background while for
  existing images the input data value is added to the background value.
  The data value is then multiplied by the gain, a poisson deviate is
  generated, and divided by the gain.  Expressed as a formula:
  <P>
  <PRE>
        New images: out = P(background * gain) / gain
   Existing images: out = P((in+background)*gain) / gain
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where P(x) is a poisson deviate with mean x, in and out are the input
  and final pixel values, and background and gain are the parameter
  values of the same name.
  <P>
  Readout or gaussian noise is generated by specifying a gaussian sigma with
  the parameter <I>rdnoise</I>.  The sigma is divided by the specified gain
  to convert to image data units.  Gaussian random numbers of mean zero are
  then generated for each pixel and added to the image, or background
  value for new images, after the photon noise is computed.
  <P>
  Generating gaussian and poisson random numbers computationally is
  the main determinant of the execution time in this task.
  Two things are done to speed up the task.
  First, the gaussian approximation is used for data values greater
  than 20 (after applying the background and gain).  The square root
  of the data value is used as the gaussian sigma about the data
  value.  For values less than 20 a true poisson deviate is generated.
  The second speed up is to allow storing a number of normalized gaussian
  values given by the package parameter <I>ranbuf</I> as they are generated.  If
  more values than this are desired then a uniform random number is used
  to select one of these stored values.  This applies to both the read noise
  and poisson noise gaussian approximation though not the true poisson
  evaluation.  For most purposes this approximation is good and one would
  need to look very hard to detect the nonrandomness in the noise.
  However, if one wants to take the extra computational time then
  by setting the <I>ranbuf</I> parameter to zero each gaussian
  random number will be generated independently.
  <P>
  The cosmic ray model is an elliptical gaussian of specified
  half-intensity radius, axial ratio, and position angle.  Normally the
  radius will be small (smaller than the point spread function) and the
  axial ratio will be 1.  The cosmic rays are subsampled and can have the
  number of centers given by the <I>nxc/nyc</I> package parameters.  The method
  of generating the cosmic rays is that described for the task
  <B>mkobjects</B>.  Specifically it is the same as adding gaussian
  profile stars.
  <P>
  The total flux (not the peak) of the cosmic ray is given by the energy
  in electrons so that the value is divided by the gain to produce the
  total flux in the image.  Note that this task can be used to add cosmic
  ray spikes to one dimensional images such as spectra but the strengths
  will appear low because of the part of the event which falls outside
  the single line.
  <P>
  The positions and energies of the cosmic rays can be specified in a
  file or the task can generate random events.  Specific cosmic rays are
  specified by a file containing lines of x and y positions and energy.
  Positions outside the limits of the image are ignored.  If no cosmic
  ray file is given or if a new, nonexistent file is named then the
  number of cosmic rays given by the <I>ncosrays</I> parameter is
  generated with uniform spatial distribution within the image and
  uniform energy distribution between zero and that given by the
  <I>energy</I> parameter.  By giving a new file name the randomly
  generated cosmic rays will be recorded for reuse or to allow
  identifying the events while testing tasks and algorithms.
