  <DD>Number of star and psf centers per pixel in X and Y.  Rather than evaluate

  <DD>Number of pixel subsamples in X and Y used in computing the star and

  <DD>Number of pixel subsamples in X and Y used in computing galaxy images.
  This is the subsampling in the central pixel and the number of
  subsamples decreases linearly from the center.  Because galaxy images
  are extended and each subsample is convolved by the psf convolution it
  need not be as finely sampled as the stars.  This is a critical
  parameter in the execution time if galaxies are being modeled.

  <! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='dynrange' Line='dynrange = 100000., psfrange = 10.'>
  <DD>The intensity profiles of the analytic functions extend to infinity so
  a dynamic range, the ratio of the peak intensity to the cutoff
  intensity, is imposed to cutoff the profiles.  The <I>dynrange</I>
  parameter applies to the stellar templates and to the galaxy profiles.
  The larger this parameter the further the profile extends.
  When modeling galaxies this has a fairly
  strong affect on the time (larger numbers means larger images and more
  execution time).  Only for very high signal-to-noise
  objects will the cutoff be noticeable.  A correction is made to
  the object magnitudes to reflect light lost by this cutoff.
  <P>
  The psf convolution, used on galaxies, is generally not
  evaluated over as large a dynamic range, given by the parameter
  <I>psfrange</I>, especially since it has a very strong affect on the
  execution time.  The convolution is normalized to unit weight over the

  This task creates or modifies images by adding models of astronomical
  objects, stars and galaxies, as specified in object lists.  New images are
  created with the specified dimensions, background, title, and real datatype.
  Existing images may be modified in place or new images output.  The
  task includes the effects of image scale, pixel sampling, atmospheric
  seeing, and noise.  The object models may be analytic one dimensional
  profiles, user defined one dimensional profiles, and user defined image
  templates.  The profiles and templates are given elliptical shapes by
  specifying a scale radius for the major axis, a minor axis to major
  axis axial ratio, and a position angle.
  <P>
  For new images a set of header keywords may be added by specifying an
  image or data file with the <I>header</I> parameter (see also <B>mkheader</B>).
  If a data file is specified lines beginning with FITS keywords are
  entered in the image header.  Leading whitespace is ignored and any
  lines beginning with words having lowercase and nonvalid FITS keyword
  characters are ignored.  In addition to this optional header,
  keywords, parameters for the gain, read noise, and exposure time are
  defined.  Finally, comments may be added to the image header recording the task
  parameters and any information from the objects file which are not
  object definitions; in particular, the <B>starlist</B> and
  <B>gallist</B> parameters are recorded.
  <P>
  A completely accurate simulation of the effects of pixel sampling,
  atmospheric seeing, object appearance, luminosity functions, and noise
  can require a large amount of computer time even on
  supercomputers.  This task is intended to allow generation of large
  numbers of objects and images over large image sizes representative of
  current deep optical astronomical images.  All this is to be done
  on typical workstations.  Thus, there are many approximations and
  subtle algorithms used to make this possible to as high a degree of
  accuracy as practical.  The discussion will try to describe these in
  sufficient detail for the user to judge the accuracy of the artificial
  data generated and understand the trade offs with many of the
  parameters.
  <P>
  New images are created with the specified dimensions, title, and real
  datatype.  The images have a constant background value given by the
  <I>background</I> parameter (in data numbers) before adding objects and
  noise.  Noise consists of gaussian and poisson components.  For existing
  images, noise is only added to the objects and the background parameter is
  used in the calculation of the poisson noise: specifically, a poisson
  random value with mean given by the sum of the object and the background is
  generated and then the background is subtracted.  For more on how the noise
  is computed and approximations used see <B>mknoise</B>.
  <P>
  Objects are specified by a position, magnitude, model, scale, axial
  ratio, and position angle.  Since the point spread function (PSF)
  is assumed constant over the image the star model, size, axial ratio,
  and position angle are specified by the task parameters <I>star</I>,
  <I>radius</I>, <I>ar</I>, and <I>pa</I>.  For galaxies, where the
  intrinsic shapes vary from object to object, these parameters are
  specified as part of the object lists.  For both types of objects the
  positions and magnitudes are specified in the object lists.
  <P>
  There is a great deal of flexibility in defining the object models.
  The models are defined either in terms of a one dimensional radial
  intensity or cumulative flux profile
  or an image template.  The flux profiles may be
  analytic functions or a user defined profile given as an equally spaced
  set of values in a text file.  The first point is zero at the center
  for a cumulative profile
  and increases monotonically to the edge.  Note that intensity profiles
  are to be preferred to avoid artifacts in the conversion from cumulative
  flux.  In particular, cumulative flux profiles may give a spike at the
  center.  In either case, the profile should be specified fairly finely,
  many points, to avoid interpolation effects.
  <P>
  The functional form of the analytic profiles the user profiles, and
  image template are given below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
        gaussian:  I = exp (-ln (2) * (R/radius)**2)
          moffat:  I = (1 + (2**(1/beta)-1) * (R/radius)**2) ** -beta
       sersic&lt;n&gt;:  I = exp (-b * (R/radius)**1/n)
         expdisk:  I = exp (-1.6783 * R/radius)
          devauc:  I = exp (-7.67 * (R/radius)**1/4)
    flux profile:  I = intensity (nprofile * R/radius)
    flux profile:  F = flux (nprofile * R/radius)
  image template:  I = image (nc/2+nc/2*dX/radius, nl/2+nc/2*dY/radius)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where R, dX, and dY are defined below, <I>radius</I> is the scale parameter
  and <I>beta</I> is the Moffat parameter specified by the user,
  nprofile is the number of profile points in the user profile, and nc and nl
  are the image template column and line dimensions.  The Gaussian, "<TT>gaussian</TT>",
  and Moffat, "<TT>moffat</TT>", profiles are used for stars and the point spread
  function, while the Sersic (sersic),  exponential disk (expdisk), and
  De Vaucouleurs (devauc) profiles are common models for spiral and elliptical
  galaxies.  The image templates are intended to model images with
  some complex structure.  The usual case is to have a very well sampled
  and high signal-to-noise image be reduced in scale (a more distant
  example), convolved with seeing (loss of detail), and noise (degraded
  signal-to-noise).  This also allows for more complex point spread
  functions.
  <P>
  The radial profiles are mapped into two dimensional objects by an elliptical
  transformation.  The image templates are also mapped by an elliptical
  transformation to rotate and stretch them.  If the output image
  coordinates are given by (x, y), and the specified object center
  coordinates are given by (xc, yc) then the transformation is defined
  as shown below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	dx = x - xc
  	dy = y - yc
  	dX = dx * cos(pa) + dy * sin(pa)
  	dY = (-dx * sin(pa) + dy * cos(pa)) / ar
  	R = sqrt (dX ** 2 + dY ** 2)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where dx and dy are the object coordinates relative to the object
  center,  dX and dY are the object coordinates in the transformed
  circular coordinates, and R is the circularly symmetric radius.
  The transformation parameters are the axial ratio <I>ar</I>
  defined as the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis,
  and the position angle <I>pa</I> defined counterclockwise from
  the x axis.
  <P>
  The <I>radius</I> parameter defines the size, in pixels, of the model
  object (before seeing for the galaxies) in the output image.  It
  consistently refers to the major axis of the object but its meaning
  does depend on the model.  For the gaussian and moffat profiles it is
  defined as the half-intensity radius.  For the sersic, expdisk, and devauc
  profiles it is defined as the half-flux radius.  For the user specified
  profiles it is the radius of the last profile point.  And for the image
  templates it is the radius of the image along the first or x axis given
  by one-half of the image dimension; i.e. nc/2.
  <P>
  The profiles of the analytic functions extend to infinity so a dynamic
  range, the ratio of the peak intensity to the cutoff intensity, is imposed
  to cutoff the profiles.  The <I>dynrange</I> package parameter applies to
  the stellar and galaxy analytic profiles.  The larger this parameter the
  further the profile extends, particularly for the large index Sersic and De
  Vaucouleurs models.  When modeling large galaxies this has a fairly strong
  affect on the execution time because the overall extent of the images
  becomes rapidly greater.  Only for very high signal-to-noise objects will
  the cutoff be noticeable.  A correction is made to account for lost light
  (light beyond the modeled dynamic range) so that an aperture magnitude
  will give the correct value for an object of the specified total magnitude.
  This can become quite significant for larger index Sersic profiles and
  for the default dynamic range.
  <P>
  The object models are integrated over the size of the image pixels.  This
  is done by subsampling, dividing up a pixel into smaller pieces called
  subpixels.  For the image templates a bilinear surface interpolation
  function is used and integrated analytically over the extent of the
  subpixels.  The user cumulative one dimensional profiles are first
  converted to intensity profiles.  The various intensity profiles are then
  binned into pixel fluxes per subpixel on a grid much finer than the
  subpixel spacing.  Then for any particular radius and object center the
  appropriate subpixel flux can be determined quickly and accurately.
  <P>
  The number of subpixels per image pixel is determined by the package
  parameters <I>nxsub</I>, <I>nysub</I>, <I>nxgsub</I>, and <I>nygsub</I>.  The
  first two apply to the stars and the PSF and the latter two apply to the
  galaxies.  Typically the subsampling will be the same in each dimension.
  The galaxies are generally  subsampled less since they will have less
  rapidly changing profiles and are convolved by the PSF.  Also, the stars
  are computed only a few times and then scaled and moved, as described
  below, while each galaxy needs to be computed separately.  Therefore, one
  can afford greater precision in the stars than in the galaxies.
  <P>
  Given an image of several hundred pixels subsampled by a factor of 100
  (10 x 10) this will be a very large number of computations.  A
  shortcut to reduce this number of operations is allow the number
  of subpixels to change as a function of distance from the
  profile center.  Since the profile center is where the intensity
  changes most rapidly with position, the greatest subsampling is needed for
  the pixel nearest the center.  Further from the object center the intensity
  changes more slowly and the number of subpixels may be reduced.
  Thus, the number of subpixels in each dimension in each pixel is
  decreased linearly with distance from the profile center.  For example,
  a pixel which is 3.2 pixels from the profile center will have
  <I>nxsub</I> - 3 subpixels in the x dimension.  There is, of course, a
  minimum of one subpixel per pixel or, in other words, no subsampling
  for the outer parts of the objects.  By adjusting the subsampling
  parameters one can set the degree of accuracy desired at the trade off of
  greatly different execution times.
  <P>
  The star shapes are assumed constant over the images and only their
  position and magnitude change.  Thus, rather than compute each desired
  star from the model profile or image template, a normalized star
  template is computed once, using the spatial transformation and
  subsampling operations described above, and simply scaled each time to
  achieve the desired magnitude and added at the requested position.
  However, the apparent star shape does vary depending on where its
  center lies within an image pixel.  To handle this a set of
  normalized star templates is precomputed over a grid of centers
  relative to the center of a pixel.  Then the template with center
  nearest to that requested, relative to a pixel center, is used.  The
  number of such templates is set by the package parameters <I>nxc</I> and
  <I>nyc</I> where the two axis typically have the same values.  The
  larger the number of centers the more memory and startup time required
  but the better the representation of this sampling effect.  The choice
  also depends on the scale of the stars since the larger the star
  profile compared to a pixel the smaller the subcentering effect is.
  This technique allows generating images with many stars, such as a
  globular cluster or a low galactic latitude field, quite
  efficiently.
  <P>
  Unlike the stars, the galaxies will each have different profiles,
  ellipticities, and position angles and so templates cannot be used (except
  for special test cases as mentioned later).  Another difference is that the
  galaxy models need to be convolved by the PSF; i.e. the shapes are defined
  prior to seeing.  The PSF convolution must also be subsampled and the
  convolution operation requires as many operations as the number of pixels
  in the PSF for each galaxy subpixel.  Thus, computing seeing convolved,
  well subsampled, large galaxy images is the most demanding task of all,
  requiring all the shortcuts described above (larger and variable
  subsampling and the subpixel flux approximation) as well as further ones.
  <P>
  The PSF used for convolving galaxies is truncated at a lower dynamic
  range than the stars according to the package parameter
  <I>psfrange</I>.  This reduces the number of elements in the convolution
  dramatically at the expense of losing only a small amount of the flux
  in the wings.  Like the stars, the PSF is precomputed on a grid of
  pixel subcenters and the appropriate PSF template is used for each
  galaxy subpixel convolution.  Unlike the stars, the truncated PSF is
  normalized to unit flux in order to conserve the total flux in the
  galaxies.  For the extended galaxies this approximation has only a very
  small effect.  As with the other approximations one may increase the
  dynamic range of the PSF at the expense of an increase in execution
  time.
  <P>
  There is an exception to using the truncated PSF.  If the size of the
  galaxy because very small, 0.01 pixel, then a stellar image is substituted.
