  <UL>
  Pdm applies a phase dispersion minimization algorithm (R. F. Stellingwerf,
  "<TT>Period Determination by Phase Dispersion Minimization</TT>", ApJ 224, 1978,
  953) to lightcurve data to determine periodicities in the data.  It also
  calculates amplitude and epoch information.
  <P>
  Pdm can be used in batch or interactive mode.  In batch
  mode the
  output is period, amplitude, and epoch for the minimum found within
  the period window.  Metacode will be produced for the data plot,
  the theta statistic plot, and the phasecurve plot.
  The metacode will be saved in the metafile.  In interactive mode the user
  can plot the data at different stages in the analysis, fit and remove
  curves from the data, reject points, set data ranges, plot and fit
  phasecurves, etc.
  <P>
  Pdm guesses at the period/frequency window to be searched unless
  the minimum
  and maximum period for the window are specified using minp and maxp.  The
  minimum period is taken as twice the chronological distance between the closest
  two points in the data.  The maximum period is taken as 4 times the distance
  between the first and last data points.
  <P>
  Pdm will work on one object at a time and the input data may
  be contained in multiple input files if desired.  The program will
  concatenate data in all the files which match the input template.
  The input files are text files containing one (x,y) pair per line or
  just a (y) value per line.  If only one value per line is found the
  program will number x sequentially (1,2,3,4,...).  If a third value
  is included on each line it will be read as the error in that
  measurement.   (The <TT>'e'</TT> key is used to toggle error bars on the phase
  plot.)
  <P>
  At startup, if the interactive flag is set, the user will be presented
  with a plot of the data and the cursor will be turned on.
  <P>
  When the user plots a phasecurve, points that are deleted or undeleted from
  the phasecurve plot will be deleted or undeleted from the working data set.
  <P>
  The ICFIT keystrokes are described elsewhere. (see help for icfit)

  Phase Dispersion Minimization User Interface (keystrokes)
  <P>
  When the program starts up it reads the data file(s) and displays
  the data on the screen as a standard mark plot.  The user is
  then placed in a graphics cursor loop with the following options
  available in addition to the standard graphics commands:
  <P>
  Note:
  The remembered period is for the last minimum found.  This
  minimum calculation is done whenever a new theta plot is graphed
  and whenever the "<TT>m</TT>" key is used.

  <DL>
  <DT><B>h -- graph data</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='h' Line='h -- graph data'>
  <DD><P>
  Make a plot on the screen, using marks, of observation time vs observed
  value. If there are more than 50 points, use dots, else use pluses.  If
  points have been deleted, draw an x through them on the plot.  If ranges
  are in effect, draw range bars along the abscissa of the plot marking
  the ranges.

  <DL>
  <DT><B>e -- toggle error bars on or off</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='e' Line='e -- toggle error bars on or off'>
  <DD><P>
  When the phase plot is on the screen and error data has been supplied,
  this key will toggle the drawing of error bars on the phase plot so that
  the user can determine how well the period found works with the data
  including this error information.
  </DD>

  <DT><B>i,k -- graph frequency or period respectively versus theta</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='i' Line='i,k -- graph frequency or period respectively versus theta'>
  <DD><P>
  Calculate the theta statistic in the period/frequency range specified
  previously.  If no period/frequency range has been specified,
  pdm guesses one.  The minimum period is taken as twice the chronological
  distance between the closest two points in the data.  The maximum
  period is taken as 4 times the distance between the first and last
  data points.  The number of theta points in this range is also a
  parameter which can be specified.
  <P>
  Next, plot theta on the screen using line drawing mode.  Plot
  either period vs theta or frequency vs theta.  Calculate the minimum
  value of theta displayed, turn the cursor back on (clgcur) and put
  the cursor x position at that minimum.
  </DD>

  <DT><B>p -- graph phase curve for period/frequency at cursor position</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='p' Line='p -- graph phase curve for period/frequency at cursor position'>
  <DD><P>
  Calculate the phase curve for the period/frequency under the
  cursor.  This assumes the user has a theta plot on the screen and
  an error message will be given otherwise.
  <P>
  The phase curve will be plotted in mark mode with two copies displayed
  and placed end to end to clarify the plot by providing continuity at
  all phases.  The amplitude and epoch values for this period are calculated
  and the phases are plotted relative to this epoch.

  <DT><B>f -- call ICFIT on displayed data</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='f' Line='f -- call ICFIT on displayed data'>
  <DD><P>
  ICFIT is used for interactive curve fitting.
  It is called with either the data values or the phase values,
  depending on which type of plot is on the screen at the time.
  Any point deleted in ICFIT will be removed from consideration in
  all subsequent calculations until restored.
  <P>
  The fit curve is retained by PDM after the return from ICFIT and
  may be subsequently subtracted from the data using the j command.
  <P>
  Note: The user must exit ICFIT using the q key before he is placed
  back into PDM.

  <DT><B>j -- subtract fit from data, use residuals</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='j' Line='j -- subtract fit from data, use residuals'>
  <DD><P>
  Just as it says. The original data is retained and can be reinstated
  with the :origdata command.  This command only applies to the data.
  The user cannot subtract a fit from the phase plot.

  <DT><B>s -- set sample range for calculations</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='s' Line='s -- set sample range for calculations'>
  <DD><P>
  This command is used to set ranges of data to be used.  The cursor is
  first positioned to the beginning of the range of interest, an s is
  struck, the program prints the prompt again:, the cursor is
  repositioned to the end of the range and a second s is struck
  completing the command.  Multiple ranges may be set and all the data
  inside the union of the ranges will be used.  Data points outside the
  ranges will be ignored until the data is reset with an :alldata
  or an :origdata command.
  <P>
  This also forces the boolean flag segments to be set true.

  <DL>
  <DT><B>g -- significance of theta at cursor x position</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='g' Line='g -- significance of theta at cursor x position'>
  <DD><P>
  The statistical significance of the period/frequency under the
  cursor is calculated by Fisher's method of randomization.
  This value is printed at the bottom of the screen.

  <DL>
  <DT><B>a -- amplitude and epoch at cursor x position</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='a' Line='a -- amplitude and epoch at cursor x position'>
  <DD><P>
  For the period/frequency under the cursor or of the plot, the amplitude
  and epoch are calculated and returned to the user.
  <P>
  This assumes that a theta plot is on the screen.

  <DT><B>m -- mark range and find minimum in this range</B></DT>
  <! Sec='DESCRIPTION' Level=0 Label='m' Line='m -- mark range and find minimum in this range'>
  <DD><P>
  This command is used exactly like the s command but has a different
  effect.  After the user has positioned the cursor and struck the m
  key twice, defining the range, the minimum value of theta is found
  in this range and its associated period/frequency is returned.

  This command toggles a y-axis flip for the plots.  This is useful when
  the user is plotting magnitudes where the smaller the ordinate value the
  larger the intensity.

  Set the number of equally spaced points in the period window for
  which theta should be calculated.  This is really a setting of
  the resolution of the theta plot and defaults to 200 since
  the calculation time for 200 points is only a few seconds.  Very

  Pdm has some problems with data sets containing a small number (&lt;20)
  points.  Generally, it will do fairly well but the theta curve may look
  strange.
  <P>
  The amplitude and epoch calculation might be improved by fitting a parabola
  to the phase curve near the minimum and near the maximum and using points
  on these parabolas for the min and max points instead of actual data points.
