  Cosmic ray events in each input image are detected and replaced by the
  average of the four neighbors.  The replacement may be performed
  directly on the input image if no output image is specified or if the
  output image name is the same as the input image name.  If a new image
  is created it is a copy of the input image except for the replaced
  pixels.  
  Optional output includes
  a plot file showing the parameters of the
  detected cosmic ray candidates and the flux ratio threshold used, a
  cosmic ray mask identifying the cosmic rays found, and
  a file of training objects marked with the image display cursor.  The
  cosmic ray mask may be used for display purposes, combined with other
  masks, and with <B>crfix</B>.
  <P>
  This task may be applied to an image previously processed to detect
  additional cosmic rays.
  <P>
  The cosmic ray detection algorithm consists of the following steps.
  First a pixel must be the brightest pixel within the specified
  detection window (either 5x5 or 7x7).  The mean flux in the surrounding
  pixels with the second brightest pixel excluded (which may also be a
  cosmic ray event) is computed and the candidate pixel must exceed this
  mean by the amount specified by the parameter <I>threshold</I>.  A plane
  is fit to the border pixels of the window and the fitted background is
  subtracted.  The mean flux (now background subtracted) and the ratio of
  this mean to the cosmic ray candidate (the brightest pixel) are
  computed.  The mean flux (x100) and the ratio (x100) are recorded for
  interactive examination if desired.
  <P>
  Once the list of cosmic ray candidates has been created and a threshold for
  the flux ratio established (by the parameter <I>fluxratio</I>, by the
  "<TT>training</TT>" method, or by using the graphics cursor in the interactive plot)
  the pixels with ratios below the threshold are replaced in the output by
  the average of the four neighboring pixels (with the second strongest pixel
  in the detection window excluded if it is one of these pixels).  Additonal
  pixels may then be detected and replaced in further passes as specified by
  the parameter <I>npasses</I>.  Note that only pixels in the vicinity of
  replaced pixels need be considered in further passes.
  <P>
  The division between the peaks of real objects and cosmic rays is made
  based on the flux ratio between the mean flux (excluding the center
  pixel and the second strongest pixel) and the candidate pixel.  This
  threshold depends on the point spread function and the distribution of
  multiple cosmic ray events and any additional neighboring light caused
  by the events.  This threshold is not strongly coupled to small changes
  in the data so that once it is set for a new type of image data it may
  be used for similar images.  To set it initially one may examine the
  scatter plot of the flux ratio as a function of the mean flux.  This
  may be done interactively or from the optional plot file produced.
  <P>
  After the initial list of cosmic ray candidates has been created and before
  the final replacing cosmic rays there are two optional steps to allow
  examining the candidates and setting the flux ratio threshold dividing
  cosmic rays from real objects.  The first optional step is define the flux
  ratio boundary by reference to user specified classifications; that is
  "<TT>training</TT>".  To do this step the <I>train</I> parameter must be set to yes.
  The user classified objects are specified by a cursor input list.  This
  list can be an actual file or the image display cursor as defined by the
  <I>objects</I> parameter.  The <I>savefile</I> parameter is also used during
  the training to record the objects specified.  The parameter specifies a
  file to append the objects selected.  This is useful when the objects are
  defined by interactive image cursor and does not make much sense when using
  an input list.
  <P>
  If the <I>objects</I> parameter is specified as a null string then
  the image display cursor will be repeatedly read until a <TT>'q'</TT> is
  entered.  The user first displays the image and then when the task
  reads the display cursor the cursor shape will change.  The user
  points at objects and types <TT>'s'</TT> for a star (or other astronomical
  object) and <TT>'c'</TT> for a cosmic ray.  Note that this input is used
  to search for the matching object in the cosmic ray candidate list
  and so it is possible the selected object is not in the list though
  it is unlikely.  The selection will be quietly ignored in that case.
  To exit the interactive selection of training objects type <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  If <TT>'g'</TT> is typed a graph of all the candidates is drawn showing
  "<TT>flux</TT>" vs. "<TT>flux ratio</TT>" (see below for more).  Training objects will
  be shown with a box and the currently set flux ratio threshold will
  also be shown.  Exiting the plot will return to entering more training
  objects.  The plot will remain and additional objects will immediately
  be shown with a new box.  Thus, if one wants to see the training
  objects identified in the plot as one selects them from the image
  display first type a <TT>'g'</TT> to draw the initial plot.  Also by switching
  to the plot with <TT>'g'</TT> allows you to draw surface plots (with <TT>'s'</TT>) or
  get the pixel coordinates of a candidate (the space key) to be
  found in the display using the coordinate readout of the display.
  Note that the display interaction is simpler than might be desired
  because this task does not directly connect to the display.
  <P>
  The most likely use for training is with the interactive image display.
  However one may prepare an input list by other means, one example
  is with <B>rimcursor</B>, and then specify the file name.  The savefile
  may also be used a cursor input to repeat the cosmic ray operation
  (but be careful not to have the cursor input and save file be the
  same file!).
  <P>
  The flux ratio threshold is determined from the training objects by
  finding the point with the minimum number of misclassifications
  (stars as cosmic rays or cosmic rays as stars).  The threshold is
  set at the lowest value so that it will always go through one of
  the cosmic ray objects.  There should be at least one of each type
  of object defined for this to work.  The following option of
  examining the cosmic ray candidates and parameters may still be
  used to modify the derived flux ratio threshold.  One last point
  about the training objects is that even if some of the points
  lie on the wrong side of the threshold they will remain classified
  as cosmic ray or non-cosmic ray.  In other words, any object
  classified by the user will remain in that classification regardless
  of the final flux ratio threshold.
  <P>
  After the training step the user will be queried to examine the candidates
  in the flux vs flux ratio plane if the <I>interactive</I> flag is set.
  Responses may be made for specific images or for all images by using
  lower or upper case answers respectively.  When the parameters are
  examined interactively the user may change the flux ratio threshold
  (<TT>'t'</TT> key).  Changes made are stored in the parameter file and, thus,
  learned for further images.  Pixels to be deleted are marked by crosses
  and pixels which are peaks of objects are marked by pluses.  The user
  may explicitly delete or undelete any point if desired but this is only
  for special cases near the threshold.  In the future keys for
  interactive display of the specific detections will be added.
  Currently a surface plot of any candidate may be displayed graphically
  in four 90 degree rotated views using the <TT>'s'</TT> key.  Note that the
  initial graph does not show all the points some of which are clearly
  cosmic rays because they have negative mean flux or flux ratio.  To
  view all data one must rewindow the graph with the <TT>'w'</TT> key or ":/"<TT>
  commands (see <B>gtools</B>).
