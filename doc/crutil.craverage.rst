  <UL>
  <B>Craverage</B> detects cosmic rays and objects using a moving block
  average filter with the central pixel and a specified number of additional
  highest pixels excluded and a median of an annulus around the block average
  box.  It avoids identification of the cores of objects as cosmic rays by
  excluding pixels within the detected objects as cosmic ray candidates.
  <P>
  The block average filter computes the average of pixels in a box with the
  central or target pixel excluded.  In addition the <I>nrej</I> parameter can
  be used to exclude that number of highest remaining pixels as possible
  contamination from cosmic rays which are larger than one pixel or possibly
  a very nearby additional cosmic ray.  The <I>nrej</I> value should be kept
  small relative to the total number of pixels in the average so that the
  average will still be elevated over the median in real underlying objects.
  The resulting average is used as the prediction for the value of the target
  pixel.  The median of the pixels in a square background annulus around the
  block average box provides the prediction for the background at the target
  pixel.
  <P>
  The target pixel is considered part of an object if the difference between
  the average value and the median background exceeds a specified threshold.
  If the pixel is NOT considered to be part of an object then if the
  difference between the pixel value and the average value exceeds a
  different specified threshold it is identified as a cosmic ray.
  <P>
  The thresholds are defined in terms of sigma factors, which may be
  different for positive and negative deviations and for object and
  cosmic ray identification.  The sigma factors multiply an estimate
  for the statistical sigma of the target pixel.  The estimate is
  either based on a noise model or sigma of pixels in a box near the
  target pixel.
  <P>
  The <I>crmask</I> parameter specifies a pixel mask for the image.  If the
  mask exists then non-zero mask values will be used to exclude pixels from
  the average, background median, and empirical sigma estimates.  Also any
  pixels with non-zero mask values will not be altered either in the output
  image or in the final mask.  If the  mask does not exist then it behaves as
  if all mask values are zero.  If all pixels in the average box or median
  annulus are previously flagged then the estimates will be undefined and
  nothing will be done to the output image or mask.  Because the task can
  use an input mask to mark pixels not to be considered it can be used
  in an iterative fashion.
  <P>
  The noise model is given by the formula
  <P>
  <PRE>
      variance = var0 + var1 * data + var2 * data^2
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where data is the maximum of zero and the average estimate for the target
  pixel.  The coefficients are all given in terms of the data numbers.  This
  model can be related to common detector parameters.  For CCDs var0 is the
  readout noise expressed as a variance in data numbers and var1 is the
  inverse gain (DN/electrons).  The second order coefficient has the
  interpretation of flat field introduced variance.
  <P>
  If all the coefficients are zero then an empirical sigma is estimated as
  follows.  The input image is divided into square blocks of size
  <I>nsig</I>.  The (unmasked) pixel values in a block are sorted and the
  pixel values nearest the 15.9 and 84.1 percentiles are selected.  These are
  the one sigma points in a Gaussian distribution.  The sigma estimate is the
  difference of these two values divided by two.  This algorithm is used to
  avoid contamination of the sigma estimate by the bad pixel values.  The
  block size must be at least 10 pixels in each dimension to provide
  sufficient pixels for a good estimate of the percentile points.  The sigma
  estimate for a pixel is the sigma from the nearest block.  A moving box is
  not used for reasons of efficiency.
  <P>
  If an output image name is specified then the output image is produced as a
  copy of the input image but with the identified cosmic ray pixels replaced
  by the average predicted value.  Other optional output images are
  the average filtered values and the sigma values.
  <P>
  If a mask is specified the detected cosmic rays will be identified with
  values given by the <I>crval</I> parameter and object pixels will be
  identified with values given by the <I>objval</I> parameter.  Note that one
  does not need to use an output image and the cosmic rays can be replaced by
  interpolation in the data using the tasks <I>crfix</I>, <I>fixpix</I>, or
  <I>ccdproc</I>.
  <P>
  One final step may be applied to the output mask.  The mask values
  identified with the <I>crval</I> and <I>objval</I> values may be grown
  by identifying pixel values within a specified radius with the same
  mask value.  Note that this step is done at the end and so any pixels
  in a preexisting input mask with the same values will also be grown.
  Also the grown pixels will not affect the output cosmic ray replaced
  image.  See <I>crgrow</I> for a further discussion.

  The image is a CCD image with a readout noise of 5 electrons
