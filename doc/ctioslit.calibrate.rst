  The input spectra are corrected for extinction and calibrated to a flux
  scale using sensitivity spectra produced by the task <B>sensfunc</B>.
  One or both calibrations may be performed by selecting the appropriate
  parameter flags.  It is an error if no calibration is specified.  Normally
  the spectra should be extinction corrected if also flux calibrating.
  The image header keywords DC-FLAG (or the dispersion type field in the
  "<TT>multispec</TT>" world coordinate system), EX-FLAG, and CA-FLAG are checked for
  dispersion solution (required), previous extinction correction, and
  previous flux calibration.  If previously calibrated the spectrum is
  skipped and a new output image is not created.
  <P>
  The input spectra are specified by a list of root names (when using record
  extension format) or full image names.  The output calibrated spectra may
  replace the input spectra if no output spectra list is specified or if the
  output name is the same as the input name.  When using record number
  extensions the output spectra will have the same extensions applied to the
  root names as those used for the input spectra.
  <P>
  When applying an extinction correction the AIRMASS keyword is sought.
  If the keyword is not present then the airmass at the time defined
  by the other header keywords is computed using the
  latitude of the observatory and observation parameters in the image
  header.  The observatory is first determined from the image under the
  keyword OBSERVAT.  If absent the observatory specified by the task
  parameter "<TT>observatory</TT>" is used.  See <B>observatory</B> for further
  details of the observatory database.  If the air mass cannot be
  determined an error results.  Currently a single airmass is used
  and no correction for changing extinction during the observation is
  made and adjustment to the middle of the exposure.  The task
  <B>setairmass</B> provides a correction for the exposure time to compute
  an effective air mass.  Running this task before calibration is
  recommended.
  <P>
  If the airmass is not in the header and cannot be computed then
  the user is queried for a value.  The value entered is then
  recorded in both the input and output image headers.  Also if
  the exposure time is not found then it is also queried and
  recorded in the image headers.
  <P>
  The extinction correction is given by the factor
  <P>
  		10. ** (0.4 * airmass * extinction)
  <P>
  where the extinction is the value interpolated from the specified
  extinction file for the wavelength of each pixel.  After extinction
  correction the EX-FLAG is set to 0.
  <P>
  When applying a flux calibration the spectra are divided by the
  aperture sensitivity which is represented by a spectrum produced by
  the task <B>sensfunc</B>.  The sensitivity spectrum is in units of:
  <P>
  	2.5 * Log10 [counts/sec/Ang / ergs/cm2/sec/Ang].
  <P>
  A new spectrum is created in "<TT>F-lambda</TT>" units - ergs/cm2/sec/Angstrom
  or "<TT>F-nu</TT>" units - ergs/cm2/sec/Hz.  The sensitivity must span the range of
  wavelengths in the spectrum and interpolation is used if the wavelength
  coordinates are not identical.  If some pixels in the spectrum being
  calibrated fall outside the wavelength range of the sensitivity function
  spectrum a warning message giving the number of pixels outside the
  range.  In this case the sensitivity value for the nearest wavelength
  in the sensitivity function is used.
  <P>
  Multiaperture instruments typically have
  a separate aperture sensitivity function for each aperture.  The appropriate
  sensitivity function for each input spectrum is selected based on the
  spectrum's aperture by appending this number to the root sensitivity function
  spectrum name.  If the <I>ignoreaps</I> flag is set, however, the aperture
  number relation is ignored and the single sensitivity spectrum (without
  extension) is applied.

  <DD>This task was revised to operate on 2D and 3D spatial spectra; i.e. long
  slit and Fabry-Perot data cubes.  This task now includes the functionality
  previously found in <B>longslit.extinction</B> and <B>longslit.fluxcalib</B>.
  <P>
  A query for the airmass and exposure time is now made if the information
  is not in the header and cannot be computed from other header keywords.

  <DT><B>CALIBRATE V2.10</B></DT>
  <! Sec='REVISIONS' Level=0 Label='CALIBRATE' Line='CALIBRATE V2.10'>
  <DD>This task was revised to operate on nonlinear dispersion corrected spectra
  and 3D images (the <B>apextract</B> "<TT>extras</TT>").  The aperture selection
  parameter was eliminated (since the header structure does not allow mixing
  calibrated and uncalibrated spectra) and the latitude parameter was
  replaced by the observatory parameter.  The observatory mechanism insures
  that if the observatory latitude is needed for computing an airmass and the
  observatory is specified in the image header the correct calibration will
  be applied.  The record format syntax is available in the <B>irs/iids</B>
  packages.  The output spectra are coerced to have real pixel datatype.
