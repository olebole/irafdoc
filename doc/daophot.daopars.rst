  <DD>The parameters of the down-weighting scheme in the fitting code used to resist
  bad data. For values of clipexp greater than 1 a residual small compared to
  cliprange standard deviations does not have its weight significantly altered,
  one with exactly <I>cliprange</I> standard deviations is assigned half its
  normal weight, and large residuals are assigned weights which fall off as the
  standard deviation to the minus clipexp power. For normal applications users
  should leave these parameter at their default value.

  <DD>The ratio of the model intensity of the brighter star computed at a distance of
  one fitting radius from the center of the fainter star, to the expected random
  error computed from the readout noise, gain and value of the PSF. The critical
  signal-to-noise ratio parameter is used to group stars. In general if a small
  value such as 0.1 divides all the stars in an image into groups less than
  <I>maxgroup</I>, then the expected random errors will determine the accuracy
  of the photometry. On the other hand if a value of critical overlap much
  greater than one is required to divide up the stars, crowding errors will
  dominate random errors. If a value of 1 is sufficient then crowding and
  random errors are roughly equivalent.

  <DD>The critical separation in scale units between two objects for an object merger
  to be considered. Objects with separations &gt; mergerad will not be merged; faint
  objects with separations &lt;= mergerad will be considered for merging. The
  default value of mergerad is sqrt (2 *(PAR1**2 + PAR2**2)), where PAR1 and PAR2
  are the half-width at half-maximum along the major and minor axes of the psf

  input photometry file buffer, DAOPHOT will resize the buffers as needed.
  The only limitation is the memory and configuration of the host computer.

  DAOPARS is a parameter set task which stores the DAOPHOT parameters
  required by all those DAOPHOT tasks which compute the PSF model, fit stars
  to the PSF model, or evaluate the PSF model.
  <P>
  Typing DAOPARS on the terminal invokes the EPAR parameter editing task. The
  DAOPARS parameters may also be edited from within an EPAR command on task,
  for example PSF, which references them. The DAOPARS parameters may also
  be changed on the command line in the usual manner when any task which
  references them is executed.
  <P>
  Any given set of DAOPARS parameters may stored in a text file along with
  the data being reduced by typing the :w command from within the EPAR task. If
  the user then sets the value of the <I>daopars</I> parameter to the name of
  the file containing the stored parameter set, the stored parameters will be
  used instead of the default set in the uparm directory.

  The predicted errors in the DAOPHOT photometry are computed per
  pixel as follows, where terms 1, 2, 3, and 4 represent the readout
  noise, the poisson noise, the flat-fielding error, and the interpolation
  error respectively. The quantities readnoise, epadu, I, M, p1, and p2
  are the readout noise in electrons, the gain in electrons per ADU,
  the pixel intensity in ADU, the PSF model intensity in ADU, the FWHM
  in x and the FWHM in y, both in pixels.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	error = sqrt (term1 + term2 + term3 + term4)  (ADU)

  The radial weighting function employed by all the PSF fitting tasks is
  the following, where dx and dy are the distance of the pixel from the
  centroid of the star being fit.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	wtr = 5.0 / (5.0 + rsq / (1.0 - rsq))
  	rsq = (dx ** 2 + dy ** 2) / fitrad ** 2
  </PRE>

  The weight assigned each pixel in the fit then becomes the following.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	wtp = wtr / error ** 2

  After a few iterations and if clipexp &gt; 0, a clipping scheme to reject bad
  data is enabled.  The weights of the pixels are recomputed as follows.
