  PEXAMINE supports five types of plots 1) an X-Y column plot 2) a histogram
  column plot 3) a radial profile plot 4) a surface plot and 5) a contour plot.
  Each supported plot type has its own parameter set which controls the
  appearance of the plot.  The names of the five parameter sets are listed below.

      cntrplot	Parameters for the contour plot

  <P>
  PEXAMINE is a general purpose tool for interactively examining and editing
  photometry catalogs produced by the APPHOT or DAOPHOT packages. It is intended
  to aid the user in assessing the accuracy of the photometry, in diagnosing
  problems with particular catalog objects, in searching the photometry data for
  relationships between the computed quantities, and in editing the catalog
  based on those observed relationships. PEXAMINE is intended to complement the
  more batch oriented editing facilities of the PSELECT task.
  <P>
  PEXAMINE takes the input catalog <I>input</I> and the corresponding image
  <I>image</I> (if defined) and produces an output catalog of selected objects
  <I>output</I> (if defined) and an output catalog of deleted objects
  <I>deletions</I> (if defined). The input catalog may be either an APPHOT/DAOPHOT
  text database or an ST binary table database. The file type of the output
  catalogs <I>output</I> and <I>deletions</I> is the same as that of <I>input</I>.
  <P>
  READING IN THE DATA
  <P>
  PEXAMINE reads the column data specified by <I>photcolumns</I> and
  <I>usercolumns</I> for up to <I>max_nstars</I> into memory. If there are more
  than <I>max_nstars</I> in the input catalog only the data for the first
  <I>max_nstars</I> is read. The <I>photcolumns</I> parameter defines the list of
  standard photometry columns to be loaded. If "<TT>daophot</TT>" or "<TT>apphot</TT>" is selected
  then the standard columns are GROUP, ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MSKY, MAG, MERR,
  CHI, SHARP and NITER and ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MSKY, MAG and MERR respectively.
  Otherwise the user must set <I>photcolumns</I> to his or her own preferred list
  of standard photometry columns. Non-standard columns may also be specified
  using the parameter <I>usercolumns</I>. Valid column lists contain the full
  names of the specified columns in upper or lower case letters, separated by
  commas. Either <I>photcolumns</I> or <I>usercolumns</I> may be redefined
  interactively by the user after the task has started up, but only at the
  expense of rereading the data from <I>input</I>.
  <P>
  PEXAMINE will fail to load a specified column if that column is not in the
  photometry database, is of a datatype other than integer or real, or adding
  that column would exceed the maximum number of columns limit currently set at
  twenty. The user can interactively examine the list of requested and loaded
  standard photometry columns, as well as list all the columns in the input after
  the task has started up.
  <P>
  GRAPHICS AND IMAGE COMMAND MODE
  <P>
  PEXAMINE accepts commands either from the graphics cursor <I>gcommands</I>
  (graphics command mode) or the image display cursor <I>icommands</I> if available
  (image command mode). PEXAMINE starts up in graphics command mode, but all the
  interactive commands are accessible from both modes and the user can switch
  modes at any time assuming that the <I>use_display</I> parameter to "<TT>yes</TT>".
  <P>
  PEXAMINE interprets the cursor position in graphics mode differently from how
  it interprets it in image command mode. In graphics command mode the cursor
  coordinates are the position of the cursor in the current plot, whereas in
  image command mode they are the x and y coordinates of the cursor in the
  displayed image. For example, if the user issues a command to PEXAMINE to
  locate the object in the catalog nearest the point in the current X-Y plot
  marked by the graphics cursor, PEXAMINE does so by searching the data for the
  object whose values of <I>xcolumn</I> and <I>ycolumn</I> most closely match those
  of the current cursor position. If the user issues a command  to PEXAMINE to
  locate the object in the catalog corresponding to the object marked on the
  image display with the image cursor, PEXAMINE does so by searching the data for
  the object whose values of <I>xposcolumn</I> and <I>yposcolumn</I> most closely
  match and fall within <I>match_radius</I> of the current cursor position.
  <P>
  Input to PEXAMINE is through single keystroke commands or colon commands.
  Keystroke commands are simple commands that may optionally use the cursor
  position but otherwise require no arguments. The PEXAMINE keystroke commands
  fall into three categories, basic commands, data examining commands and data
  editing commands, all described in detail in the following sections. Colon
  commands take an optional argument and function differently depending on the
  presence or absence of that argument. When the argument is absent colon
  commands are used to display the current value of a parameter or list of
  parameters. When the argument is present they change their current value to
  that argument. The basic colon commands are described in detail below. 
  <P>

  DATA EXAMINING COMMANDS
  <P>
  The data examining commands fall into two categories, those that examine the
  catalog data including <TT>'l'</TT> (catalog listing), <TT>'o'</TT> (object listing), <TT>'x'</TT> (Y
  column versus X column plot) and <TT>'h'</TT> (histogram column plot) commands, and
  those which examine the image data around specific catalog objects including
  <TT>'r'</TT> (radial profile plotting), <TT>'s'</TT> (surface plotting), <TT>'c'</TT> (contour plotting)
  and <TT>'m'</TT> (pixel dumping). The latter group require that <I>image</I> be defined.

  DATA EDITING COMMANDS
  <P>
  Data points can be deleted from the catalog in either graphics command mode or
  image command mode. In graphics command mode the graphics cursor and either the
  X-Y or histogram plot is used to delete points. In image command mode the image
  cursor and the displayed image are used to delete points. A data point has three
  possible states good, marked for deletion and deleted. Any one of the keystroke
  commands <TT>'d'</TT> (delete point), <TT>'('</TT> (delete points with x less than x cursor),
  <TT>')'</TT> (delete points with x greater than x cursor, <TT>'^'</TT> (delete points with y &gt; y
  cursor), <TT>'v'</TT> (delete points with y &lt; y cursor) or <TT>'b'</TT> (delete points in a box)
  can be used to mark points for deletion. The <TT>'f'</TT> key is used to actually delete
  the points and replot the data. In between marking the points for deletion and
  actually deleting the marked points the <TT>'t'</TT> (toggle) key can be used to undelete
  the last set marked. The full list of the data editing keystroke commands is
  given below.
