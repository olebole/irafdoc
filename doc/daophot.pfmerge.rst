  <DD>The output photometry file. Outphotfile consists of the header of the first
  input photometry file, followed by a list of records, one per input file
  record, each consisting of five fields: ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MAG, and MSKY.
  Outphotfile is a an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database if the first photometry file
  is a text database, an STSDAS binary table if the first photometry file is an
  ST table.

  PFMERGE creates a new photometry file suitable for input to PSF, PEAK, GROUP,
  or ALLSTAR by extracting the header of the first input photometry file and the
  values of the five fields: ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MAG, and MSKY from each
  photometry record in each input file, and writing them to <I>outphotfile</I>.
  <I>Inphotfiles</I> may be either APPHOT/DAOPHOT text databases or STSDAS binary
  tables, but <I>outphotfile</I> inherits the type of the first input photometry
  file.
  <P>
  The principal application of PFMERGE is to combine the results of one of the
  DAOPHOT fitting tasks, e.g. ALLSTAR, with the results of the aperture photometry
  task PHOT, to create a new photometry file suitable for input to the fitting
  task. e.g. ALLSTAR, since it if often the case that the user wishes to combine
  preliminary results for a few additional stars with the best fit results to
  date on the original star list. 
  <P>
  PFMERGE is intended to combine photometry files from different DAOPHOT tasks.
  The task PCONCAT can be used to combine photometry files produced by the same
  task.

  1. Combine the results of the first allstar run with phot task results
  on a small list of stars detected after the first list of stars was
  subtracted from the original image.
