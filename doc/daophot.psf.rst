  <P>
  The PSF task builds the point spread function for the IRAF image <I>image</I>
  using stars selected, from the input photometry file <I>photfile</I> with the
  image cursor, and/or by their ids stored in the psf star file <I>pstfile</I>,
  and writes the PSF model out to the IRAF image <I>psfimage</I>, the final
  PSF star list to <I>opstfile</I>, and group membership information for the
  selected PSF stars to <I>groupfile</I>. If the DAOPHOT package parameter
  <I>text</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", then <I>groupfile</I> is an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database,
  otherwise it is an STSDAS binary table.
  <P>
  The coordinates read from <I>photfile</I> and <I>pstfile</I> are assumed to be
  in coordinate system defined by <I>wcsin</I>. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>",
  "<TT>physical</TT>", and "<TT>world</TT>" and the transformation from the input coordinate
  system to the internal "<TT>logical</TT>" system is defined by the image coordinate
  system. The simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" pixel system. Users working on
  with image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the
  parent image must use the "<TT>tv</TT>" or "<TT>physical</TT>" input coordinate systems.
  <P>
  The coordinates written to <I>psfimage</I>, <I>pstfile</I> and <I>groupfile</I>
  are in the coordinate system defined by <I>wcsout</I> with the exception
  of the psf model center coordinates PSFX and PSFY which are always in the
  logical system of the input image. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>", and
  "<TT>physical</TT>". The simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" system.  Users wishing to
  correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in image sections or
  mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent image must use the "<TT>tv</TT>"
  or "<TT>physical</TT>" coordinate systems.
  <P>
  Suitable PSF stars are normally selected interactively using the image display
  and image cursor and matched with the stars in <I>photfile</I> using the cursor
  position and a tolerance specified by the <I>matchrad</I> parameter in the
  DAOPARS task. A star must be in the photometry file before it can be used as
  a PSF star. If a match is found, PSF checks that the candidate star is not too
  close to the edge of the image and that it contains no bad pixels as defined
  by <I>datamin</I> and <I>datamax</I> in the DATAPARS task. After selection a
  mesh, contour, or profile plot of the data subraster around the candidate star
  is displayed in the graphics window, PSF enters graphics cursor command mode
  and the user is given the option to accept or reject the star.  If the user
  accepts the star it is added to the PSF star list.  Commands in the graphics
  cursor menu permit the user to manipulate the floor and ceiling levels of the
  contour plot and the viewing angles for the mesh plot interactively.
  <P>
  Users who know which stars they wish to use as PSF stars ahead of time or
  who are without access to an image display can also select PSF stars by id
  number, after which mesh, contour, or radial profile plots will be displayed in
  the graphics window in the usual way.
  <P>
  If the user does not wish to see any plots of the PSF stars or interact with
  the fitting process, the image cursor may be redirected to a text
  file containing cursor commands <I>icommands</I> which specify the PSF stars
  to be used in the fit. If <I>plotfile</I> is defined contour, mesh, or profile
  plots of the selected psf stars can be saved in a metacode plot file for later
  examination.
  <P>
  In interactive mode the PSF star may be initialized by setting <I>pstfile</I>
  to a file created by the PSTSELECT task. If <I>showplot</I> = "<TT>yes</TT>" the user is
  asked to accept or delete each star in the input psf star list.  Other stars
  may also be added or deleted from this list at any time with the image cursor.
  If <I>interactive</I>=no or <I>icommands</I> is defined, the PSF stars are read
  in from <I>pstfile</I>, and the PSF model is computed and saved without
  input from the user.
  <P>
  If <I>cache</I> is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
  are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If caching
  is enabled and PSF is run interactively the first data access will appear
  to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the data
  is actually read. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because PSF
  is accessing memory not disk. The point of caching is to speed up random
  image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
  image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
  sparse caching may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
  present there is no point in enabling caching for images that are less than
  or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
  default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
  is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
  effect of caching in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
  of objects in the top and bottom halves of the image are alternated.
  <P>
  The output PSF image <I>psfimage</I>  is normally a 2D  image containing the
  image header parameters, "<TT>XPSF</TT>", "<TT>YPSF</TT>", "<TT>PSFMAG</TT>" and "<TT>PSFRAD</TT>" which define the
  centroid, magnitude and size of the PSF model, the parameters "<TT>FUNCTION</TT>",
  "<TT>PSFHEIGH</TT>", "<TT>NPARS</TT>", and "<TT>PAR#</TT>" which define the analytic component of the PSF,
  and a single look-up table of residuals from the analytic fit subsampled by a
  factor of 2 with respect to the parent image.
  <P>
  If the DAOPARS parameter <I>varorder</I> = -1, the PSF is fit by the analytic
  function and <I>psfimage</I> has no pixel file.
  <P>
  If the DAOPARS parameter <I>varorder</I> = 1 or 2, then two or five additional
  lookup tables are computed and <I>psfimage</I> is a 3D image with 3 or 6 planes
  respectively. The first two additional look-up tables contain the first
  derivatives of the PSF wrt the x and y positions in the image (varorder = 1),
  and the next three contains the second derivatives with respect to x ** 2, xy,
  and y ** 2 (varorder = 2).
  <P>
  The positions and magnitudes of each of the stars contributing to the PSF model
  are also stored in the PSF image header.
  <P>
  <I>Groupfile</I> contains a list of the PSF stars, their nearest neighbors, and
  friends of the neighbors. A neighbor is defined to be any star within a
  distance of 1.5 * <I>psfrad</I> / <I>scale</I> + 2.0 * <I>fitrad</I> /
  <I>scale</I> + 1 pixels of the PSF star. Friends of the neighbors are defined
  to be any stars within 2.0 * <I>fitrad</I> / <I>scale</I> + 1.0 of a neighbor
  star. <I>Fitrad</I> and <I>psfrad</I> are respectively the fitting radius and psf
  radius parameters in the DAOPARS task. <I>Scale</I> is the scale factor defined
  in the DATAPARS task.

  The PSF is determined from the actual observed brightness values as a function
  of x and y 
  for one or more stars in the frame and stored as a two-component model.
  The first component is an analytic function which approximates
  the light distribution in the cores of the PSF stars. There are
  currently 6 choices for the analytic component of the model:
  "<TT>gauss</TT>", "<TT>moffat15</TT>", "<TT>moffat25</TT>", "<TT>lorentz</TT>", "<TT>penny1</TT>", and "<TT>penny2</TT>".
  The parameters of the analytic component of the psf model are stored
  in the psf image header parameters "<TT>FUNCTION</TT>", "<TT>PSFHEIGH</TT>", "<TT>NPARS</TT>",
  and "<TT>PARN</TT>". The magnitude, size, and centroid of the PSF are stored
  in the image header parameters "<TT>PSFMAG</TT>", "<TT>PSFRAD</TT>", 
  "<TT>XPSF</TT>", "<TT>and </TT>"YPSF"<TT>. If <I>matchbyid</I> is "<TT>no</TT>" or there is no input psf star list "<TT>PSFMAG</TT>" is
  set to the magnitude of the first PSF star in the input photometry file. If <I>matchbyid</I>
  is "<TT>yes</TT>", and there is an input psf star list "<TT>PSFMAG</TT>" is set to the magnitude of the first psf star
  in the psf star list. "<TT>XPSF</TT>" and "<TT>YPSF</TT>" are the center of the image.
  If <I>varorder</I> &gt;= 0,
  the residuals from this fit are stored as a lookup
  table with twice the sampling interval of the original image.
  This lookup table is used as additive corrections from the integrated
  analytic function to actual observed empirical PSF.
  The parameters of the analytic function are computed by fitting
  all the stars weighted by their signal-to-noise.
  so that the signal-to-noise ratio in
  the PSF does not deteriorate as fainter stars are added in. The more
  crowded the field the more PSF stars are required to lower the noise
  generated by neighbor subtraction.
  <P>
  If the <I>varorder</I> parameter in the DAOPARS task is set to 1 or 2, two
  or five additional lookup
  tables containing the first derivatives of the PSF in x and y 
  and the second order derivatives of the image with respect to
  x ** 2, x * y, and y ** 2 are also written.
  This model
  permits the PSF fitting process to take account of smooth linear
  or quadratic changes in the PSF across the frame caused for example by a tilt in
  the detector with respect to the optical axis or low order optical
  aberrations.
  Users of this option should ensure that the PSF varies in a systematic
  way across the frame and that the chosen PSF stars span the entire
  region of interest in the frame. To avoid mistaking
  neighbor stars for variations in the PSF it is recommended that the
  first few iterations of PSF be run with a constant PSF. Only after
  neighbor stars have been subtracted reasonably cleanly should
  the variable PSF option be enabled.
  <P>
  The brightness of any hypothetical pixel at any arbitrary point within
  the PSF is computed as follows. The analytic function 
  is integrated over the area of the pixel, a correction is determined
  by bicubic interpolation within the lookup table and added to the
  integral. Since the values in the table of residuals differ by smaller
  amounts between adjacent grid points than the original brightness data
  would have, the errors in the interpolation are much less than they would
  have been if one  had tried to interpolate directly within the original
  data.

  The following is a rough guide to the methodology of computing the
  PSF in a crowded field. The procedure outlined below assumes
  that the user can either make use of the IRAF display facilities or
  has access to a local display program. At a minimum the display program
  should be able to display an image, read back the coordinates of objects in the
  image, and mark objects in the image.
  <P>
  The crowded field PSF fitting procedure makes use of many of the
  DAOPHOT tasks. Details on the setup and operation of each task can be found
  in the appropriate manual pages.

  Using the display itself, the DAOEDIT task, or the IRAF IMEXAMINE task, estimate the radius
  at which
  the stellar light distribution disappears into the noise for the
  brightest candidate PSF star. Call this parameter <I>psfrad</I> and record it.
  Mark the objects detected by DAOFIND with dots on the image display using the
  IRAF TVMARK
  task. Users at sites with display devices not currently supported by
  IRAF should substitute their local versions of DISPLAY and TVMARK.

  <DD>SELECT CANDIDATE PSF STARS.
  Good PSF stars should have no neighbors
  within the fitting radius stored in the DAOPARS task parameter <I>fitrad</I>.
  In addition all stars within 1.5 times the psf radius,
  (stored in the DAOPARS task parameter
  <I>psfrad</I>), should be significantly fainter than the candidate star.
  There should be no bad columns, bad rows or blemishes
  near the candidate star. A sufficient number of stars should be
  selected in order to reduce the increased noise resulting from the
  neighbor subtraction process. Users of the variable PSF option should
  take care that the list of PSF stars span the area of interest on the
  image. Twenty-five to thirty stars is not unreasonable in this case.
  <P>
  The task PSTSELECT can be used to preselect candidate PSF stars.
  These candidate PSF stars can be marked on the image display using the
  PDUMP, and TVMARK tasks. Be sure to mark the PSF stars in another
  color from the stars found by DAOFIND. Stars can be added to or
  subtracted from this list interactively when PSF is run.
