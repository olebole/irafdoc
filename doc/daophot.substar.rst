  <DD>Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
  The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
  input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
  coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
  dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are

  <DD>Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
  coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
  include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
  image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
  identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
  section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
  a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
  In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
  2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]

  was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
  coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
  coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
  coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
  coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D

  <DD>World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant

  example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter

  must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g.

  SUBSTAR task takes an input photometry list <I>photfile</I> containing
  the fitted coordinates and magnitudes, and an input PSF <I>psfimage</I>, and
  for each star in the photometry list scales and shifts the PSF and subtracts
  it from the input image <I>image</I>. The final subtracted image is saved in the
  output image <I>subimage</I>.
  <P>
  The input photometry list can be the output from of the PEAK, NSTAR or ALLSTAR
  tasks or even the PHOT task although most people would not want to use the PHOT
  output for this purpose.
  <P>
  Selected stars may be omitted from the subtraction by supplying their ids in
  the file <I>exfile</I>. <I>Exfile</I> is normally the output the PSTSELECT task
  and is used to tell SUBSTAR to subtract the PSF star neighbors, but not the
  PSF stars themselves.
  <P>
  The coordinates read from <I>photfile</I> are assumed to be in coordinate
  system defined by <I>wcsin</I>. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>", "<TT>physical</TT>",
  and "<TT>world</TT>" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to the
  internal "<TT>logical</TT>" system is defined by the image coordinate system. The
  simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" pixel system. Users working on with image
  sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent image
  must use the "<TT>tv</TT>" or "<TT>physical</TT>" input coordinate systems.
  <P>
  The coordinate system of the PSF model is the coordinate system defined by the
  <I>wcspsf</I> parameter. Normally the PSF model was derived from the input image
  and this parameter default to "<TT>logical</TT>". However if the PSF model was derived
  from a larger image which is a "<TT>parent</TT>" of the input image, then wcspsf should
  be set to "<TT>tv</TT>" or "<TT>physical</TT>" depending on the circumstances.
  <P>
  The coordinates written to the standard output if <I>verbose</I> = yes are in the
  coordinate system defined by <I>wcsout</I>. The options are "<TT>logical</TT>", "<TT>tv</TT>",
  and "<TT>physical</TT>". The simplest default is the "<TT>logical</TT>" system. Users wishing to
  correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in image sections or
  mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent image must use the "<TT>tv</TT>" or
  "<TT>physical</TT>" coordinate systems.
  <P>
  If <I>cache</I> is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
  are large enough the input and output image pixels are cached in memory. If
  caching is enabled and SUBSTAR is run interactively the first subtraction
  will appear to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before
  the measurement is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very
  fast because SUBSTAR is accessing memory not disk. The point of caching is
  to speed up random image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the
  same size as the image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted
  in row order which SUBSTAR does internally  and are sparse caching may
  actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at present there is no
  point in enabling caching for images that are less than or equal to 524288
  bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the default image i/o
  buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix is doubled by
  converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the effect of
  caching in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
  of objects in the top and bottom halves of the image are alternated.
  <P>
  <P>
  The SUBSTAR task is most commonly used to check on the quality of the PSF
  fitting produced by PEAK and NSTAR, to search for non-stellar objects and close
  binary stars, to generate an improved PSF in crowded fields, and to remove
  neighbors from bright stars which are to be used to determine aperture
  corrections.
