  Files will be read in ascending order, regardless of the order of the list.
  Reading will terminate if EOT is reached, thus a list such as "<TT>1-999</TT>"

  T2d reads files from tape and puts them into disk files.  No formatting is
  performed so the bits and bytes are in the same order on disk as they were
  on tape.  The program uses double buffering and asynchronous i/o to speed
  things up as much as possible.
  <P>
  When read errors are encountered one of two things can happen.  Depending
  on the value of the parameter 'errignore', the error record is either
  thrown out or considered valid data.  If 'errignore' is 'no' when an error
  is found, the input buffer is validated to the most recent 'good record'
  length and written to disk.  If 'errignore' is 'yes' when an error is
  found, the input buffer is disposed of for that record.

  <UL>
  1. To read the second image from mta at 1600 bpi, store the image into
  "<TT>image</TT>" and see verbose output the command would be:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; t2d mta1600[2] image
  </PRE>
  <P>
  2. To read all the files on mtb at the default speed of 1600 bpi and put
  the disk files in root001, root002, root003, etc. and turn off verbose
  output, the command would be:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; t2d mtb root v-
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The program will prompt the user and ask for the list of files to be read
  to which the response would be "<TT>1-999</TT>".
