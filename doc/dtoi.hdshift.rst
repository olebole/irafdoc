  For each file in <B>database</B>, procedure <B>hdshift</B> calculates and 
  subtracts a zero point shift to bring several related HD curves into
  alignment.  The individual shifts are calculated by elimination of the 
  first coefficient (Bevington, eqn 9-3):
  <PRE>
                  _      _      _               _
             a0 = y - a1*X - a2*X**2 - ... - an*X**n
  <P>
  </PRE>
  Here, the averages over y and X refer to individual <B>database</B> averages; 
  the coefficients a1, ... an were previously calculated using data from all 
  <B>database</B>s, in task <I>hdfit</I>, and stored in the database.  The
  a0 term is calculated individually for each database; this term represents
  the zero point shift in log exposure and will be different for each database.
  <P>
  On output, the log exposure values in each <B>database</B> have been 
  shifted to the zero point shift of the first database in the list.  The
  log exposure records are now aligned and it would be appropriate
  to run task <I>hdfit</I> on the modified <B>database</B> list and
  determine the common solution.
