  It is sometimes the case that it is undesirable to simply divide
  two dimensional format spectra taken through fibers, aperture masks
  with small apertures such as holes and slitlets, or small slits in
  echelle formats by a flat field observation of a lamp.  This is due
  to the sharp dropoff of the flat field and object profiles and
  absence of signal outside of the profile.  Slight shifts or changes
  in profile shape introduce bad edge effects, unsightly "<TT>grass</TT>" is
  produced where there is no signal (which may also confuse extraction
  programs), and the division will also remove the characteristic
  profile of the object which might be needed for tracking the
  statistical significance, variance weighted extraction, and more.
  A straight flat field division also has the problem of changing the
  shape of the spectrum in wavelength, again compromising the
  poisson statistics and artificially boosting low signal regions.
  <P>
  There are three approaches to consider.  First, the
  flat field correction can be done after extraction to one dimension.
  This is valid provided the flat field and object profiles don't shift
  much.  However, for extractions that depend on a smooth profile,
  such as the variance weighting algorithms of this package, the sensitivity
  corrections must remain small; i.e. no large fringes or other
  small scale variations that greatly perturb the true photon profile.
  The second approach is to divide out the overall spectral shape of
  the flat field spectrum, fill regions outside of the signal with
  one and leave the profile shape intact.  This will still cause profile
  division problems described earlier but is mentioned here since it
  implemented in a related task called <B>apnormalize</B>.  The last
  approach is to model both the profile and overall spectrum shape and
  remove it from the flat field leaving only the sensitivity variations.
  This is what the task <B>apflatten</B> does.
  <P>
  The two dimensional flat field spectra within the defined apertures of
  the input images are fit by a model having the profile of the data and
  a smooth spectral shape.  This model is then divided into the flat
  field image within the aperture, replacing points of low signal, set
  with the <I>threshold</I> parameter, within the aperture and all points
  outside the aperture by one to produce an output sensitivity variation
  only flat field image.
  <P>
  A two dimensional normalized profile is computed by dividing the data
  within the aperture by the one dimensional spectrum and smoothing with
  low order function fits parallel to the dispersion axis if the aperture
  is well aligned with the axis or parallel to the traced aperture center
  if the trace is tilted relative to the dispersion axis.  The smooth
  profile is then used to improve the spectrum estimate using variance
  weighting and to eliminate deviant or cosmic ray pixels by sigma
  tests.  The profile algorithm is described in detail in
  <B>approfiles</B> and the variance weighted spectrum is described in
  <B>apvariance</B>.
  <P>
  The process of determining the profile and variance weighted spectrum,
  and hence the two dimensional spectrum model, is identical to that used
  for variance weighted extraction of the one dimensional spectra in the
  tasks <B>apall</B> or <B>apsum</B> and in making a two dimensional
  spectrum model in the task <B>apfit</B>.  Most of the parameters in
  this task are the same in those tasks and so further information about
  them may be found in their descriptions.  In fact, up to this point the
  task is the same as <B>apfit</B> and, if the flat field were normalized
  by this model it would produce the "<TT>ratio</TT>" output of that task.
  <P>
  This task deviates from <B>apfit</B> in that the final variance weighted
  one dimensional spectrum of the flat field is subjected to a smoothing
  operation.  This is done by fitting a function to the spectrum using
  the <B>icfit</B> routine.  This may be done interactively or
  noninteractively depending on the <B>interactive</B> parameter.  The
  default fitting parameters are part of this task.  The goal of the
  fitting is to follow the general spectral shape of the flat field light
  (usually a lamp) but not the small bumps and wiggles which are the one
  dimensional projection of sensitivity variations.  When the fitted
  function is multiplied into the normalize profile and then the two
  dimensional model divided into the data the sensitivity variations not
  part of the fitted spectrum are what is left in the final output flat
  field.
  <P>
  The remainder of this description covers the basic steps defining the
  apertures to be used.  These steps and parameter are much the same as
  in any of the other <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  Aperture definitions may be inherited from those of other images by
  specifying a reference image with the <B>references</B> parameter.
  Images in the reference list are matched with those in the input list
  in order.  If the reference image list is shorter than the number of
  input images, the last reference image is used for all remaining input
  images.  Thus, a single reference image may be given for all the input
  images or different reference images may be given for each input
  image.  The special reference name "<TT>last</TT>" may be used to select the
  last set apertures used in any of the <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  If an aperture reference image is not specified or no apertures are
  found for the specified reference image, previously defined apertures
  for the input image are sought in the aperture database.  Note that
  reference apertures supersede apertures for the input image.  If no
  apertures are defined they may be created automatically, the <I>find</I>
  option, or interactively in the aperture editor, if the
  <I>interactive</I> and <I>edit</I> options are set.
  <P>
  The functions performed by the task are selected by a set of flag
  parameters.  The functions are an automatic spectrum finding and
  aperture defining algorithm (see <B>apfind</B>) which is ignored if
  apertures are already defined, automatic recentering and resizing
  algorithms (see <B>aprecenter</B> and <B>apresize</B>), an interactive
  aperture editing function (see <B>apedit</B>), a spectrum position tracing
  and trace function fit (see <B>aptrace</B>), and the main function of
  this task, the flat field profile and spectral shape modeling and removal.
  <P>
  Each function selection will produce a query for each input spectrum if
  the <I>interactive</I> parameter is set.  The queries are answered by
  "<TT>yes</TT>", "<TT>no</TT>", "<TT>YES</TT>", or "<TT>NO</TT>", where the upper case responses suppress
  the query for following images.  There are other queries associated
  with tracing which first ask whether the operation is to be done
  interactively and, if yes, lead to queries for each aperture.  If the
  <I>interactive</I> parameter is not set then aperture editing
  interactive trace fitting, and interactive spectrum shape fitting are ignored.
