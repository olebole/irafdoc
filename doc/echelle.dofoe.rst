  The <B>dofoe</B> reduction task is specialized for scattered light
  subtraction, extraction, flat fielding, and wavelength calibration of Fiber
  Optic Echelle (FOE) spectra.  There may be one fiber or two fibers where
  the second fiber is illuminated by an arc calibration during arc and object
  exposures and a flat field during flat field exposures.  It is a command
  language script which collects and combines the functions and parameters of
  many general purpose tasks to provide a single complete data reduction
  path.  The task provides a degree of guidance, automation, and record
  keeping necessary when dealing with the complexities of reducing this type
  of data.

  this parameter specifies a list of aperture numbers for the arc fibers.
  Since the object and arc fiber orders are paired the default setting

  "<TT>median</TT>" to use the median in background regions, "<TT>minimum</TT>" to use the
  minimum in background regions, or "<TT>fit</TT>" to fit across the dispersion using
  the background within background regions.  The scattered light option fits
  and subtracts a smooth global background and modifies the input images.
  This is a slow operation and so is NOT performed in quicklook mode.  The
  other background options are local to each aperture at each point along the
  dispersion.  The "<TT>fit</TT>" option uses additional fitting parameters from
  <B>params</B> and the "<TT>scattered</TT>" option uses parameters from <B>apscat1</B>

  The <B>dofoe</B> reduction task is specialized for scattered light
  subtraction, extraction, flat fielding, and wavelength calibration of Fiber
  Optic Echelle (FOE) spectra.  There may be one fiber or two fibers where
  the second fiber is illuminated by an arc calibration during arc and object
  exposures and a flat field during flat field exposures.  When there is
  just one fiber the parameter <I>arcaps</I> is set to "<TT></TT>" and when there are
  two fibers the parameter is used to select which of the defined
  apertures are the orders from the simultaneous arc fiber.
  <P>
  This task is a command language script which collects and combines the
  functions and parameters of many general purpose tasks to provide a single
  complete data reduction path.  The task provides a degree of guidance,
  automation, and record keeping necessary when dealing with the complexities
  of reducing this type of data.
  <P>
  The general organization of the task is to do the interactive setup steps
  first using representative calibration data and then perform the majority
  of the reductions automatically, possibly as a background process, with
  reference to the setup data.  In addition, the task determines which setup
  and processing operations have been completed in previous executions of the
  task and, contingent on the <I>redo</I> and <I>update</I> options, skip or
  repeat some or all the steps.
  <P>
  The description is divided into a quick usage outline followed by details
  of the parameters and algorithms.  The usage outline is provided as a
  checklist and a refresher for those familiar with this task and the
  component tasks.  It presents only the default or recommended usage.  Since
  <B>dofoe</B> combines many separate, general purpose tasks the description
  given here refers to these tasks and leaves some of the details to their

  <B>Spectra and Data Files</B>
  <P>
  The basic input consists of single or dual fiber FOE object and calibration
  spectra stored as IRAF images.  The <I>arcaps</I> parameter is used to
  discriminate between the two cases.  The type of image format is defined by
  the environment parameter <I>imtype</I>.  Only images with that extension
  will be processed and created.  The raw CCD images must be processed to
  remove overscan, bias, and dark count effects.  This is generally done
  using the <B>ccdred</B> package.  Flat fielding is generally not done at
  this stage but as part of <B>dofoe</B>.  The calibration spectra are flat
  field observations in all fibers, comparison arc lamp spectra in all
  fibers, and, for dual fiber model, arc spectra in one fiber while the
  second fiber observes the object.  If for some reason the flat field or
  calibration arc spectra have separate exposures for the two fibers the
  separate exposures may simply be added.
  <P>
  The assignment of arc calibration exposures to object exposures is
  generally done by selecting the nearest in time and interpolating.
  However, the optional <I>arc assignment table</I> may be used to explicitly
  assign arc images to specific objects.  The format of this file is
  described in the task <B>refspectra</B>.
  <P>
  The final reduced spectra are recorded in two or three dimensional IRAF
  images.  The images have the same name as the original images with an added
  "<TT>.ec</TT>" extension.  Each line in the reduced image is a one dimensional
  spectrum (an echelle order) with associated aperture and wavelength
  information.  When the <I>extras</I> parameter is set the lines in the
  third dimension contain additional information (see
  <B>apsum</B> for further details).  These spectral formats are accepted by the
  one dimensional spectroscopy tasks such as the plotting tasks <B>splot</B>
  and <B>specplot</B>.  The special task <B>scopy</B> may be used to extract
  specific apertures or to change format to individual one dimensional
  images.  The task <B>scombine</B> is used to combine or merge orders into
  a single spectrum.
  <P>
  <B>Package Parameters</B>
  <P>
  The <B>echelle</B> package parameters set parameters affecting all the tasks
  in the package.  Some of the parameters are not applicable to the
  <B>dofoe</B> task.  The observatory parameter is only required for data
  without an OBSERVAT header parameter (currently included in NOAO data).
  The spectrum interpolation type might be changed to "<TT>sinc</TT>" but with the
  cautions given in <B>onedspec.package</B>.  The dispersion axis parameter is
  only needed if a DISPAXIS image header parameter is not defined.  The other
  parameters define the standard I/O functions.  The verbose parameter
  selects whether to print everything which goes into the log file on the
  terminal.  It is useful for monitoring what the <B>dofoe</B> task does.  The
  log and plot files are useful for keeping a record of the processing.  A
  log file is highly recommended.  A plot file provides a record of
  apertures, traces, and extracted spectra but can become quite large.
  The plotfile is most conveniently viewed and printed with <B>gkimosaic</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Processing Parameters</B>
  <P>
  The input images are specified by image lists.  The lists may be
  a list of explicit, comma separate image names, @ files, or image
  templates using pattern matching against file names in the directory.
  The aperture reference spectrum is used to find the orders and trace
  them.  Thus, this requires an image with good signal in both fibers
  which usually means a flat field spectrum.  It is recommended that
  flat field correction be done using one dimensional extracted spectra
  rather than as two dimensional images.  This is done if a flat field
  spectrum is specified.  The arc assignment table is used to specifically
  assign arc spectra to particular object spectra and the format
  of the file is described in <B>refspectra</B>.
  <P>
  The detector read out noise and gain are used for cleaning and variance
  (optimal) extraction.  The dispersion axis defines the wavelength direction
  of spectra in the image if not defined in the image header by the keyword
  DISPAXIS.  The width parameter (in pixels) is used for the profile
  centering algorithm (<B>center1d</B>).
  <P>
  The number of orders selects the number of orders for a single
  fiber and "<TT>pairs</TT>" of object and arc
  fiber profiles for dual fibers.   The number specified will be
  automatically found based on the strongest peaks.
  In the  dual fiber case it is important that both elements of a pair be found,
  so no orders be skipped, and the aperture numbers must be sequential with
  arc profiles having even aperture numbers and object profiles having
  odd numbers in the region of interest, the automatic identification is  
  just a starting point for the interactive review.  The even/odd
  relationship between object and arc profiles is set by the <I>arcaps</I>
  parameter and so may be reversed if desired.
  <P>
  The next set of parameters select the processing steps and options.  The
  flat fitting option allows fitting and removing the overall shape of the
  flat field spectra while preserving the pixel-to-pixel response
  corrections.  This is useful for maintaining the approximate object count
  levels, including the blaze function, and not introducing the reciprocal of
  the flat field spectrum into the object spectra.  If not selected the flat
  field will remove the blaze function from the observations and introduce
  some wavelength dependence from the flat field lamp spectrum.
  <P>
  The <I>background</I> option selects the type of correction for background or
  scattered light.  If the type is "<TT>scattered</TT>" a global scattered light is
  fit to the data between the apertures  and subtracted from the images.
  <I>Note that the input images are modified by this operation</I>.  This
  option is slow.  Alternatively, a local background may be subtracted using
  background regions defined for each aperture.  The data in the regions may
  be averaged, medianed, or the minimum value used.  Another choice is to fit
  the data in the background regions by a function and interpolate to the
  object aperture.
  <P>
  The <I>clean</I> option invokes a profile fitting and deviant point rejection
  algorithm as well as a variance weighting of points in the aperture.  These
  options require knowing the effective (i.e. accounting for any image
  combining) read out noise and gain.  For a discussion of cleaning and
  variance weighted extraction see <B>apvariance</B> and <B>approfiles</B>.
  <P>
  The dispersion correction option selects whether to extract arc spectra,
  determine a dispersion function, assign them to the object spectra, and,
  possibly, resample the spectra to a linear (or log-linear) wavelength
  scale.
  <P>
  Generally once a spectrum has been processed it will not be reprocessed if
  specified as an input spectrum.  However, changes to the underlying
  calibration data can cause such spectra to be reprocessed if the
  <I>update</I> flag is set.  The changes which will cause an update are a new
  reference image, new flat field, adding the scattered light option, and a
  new arc reference image.  If all input spectra are to be processed
  regardless of previous processing the <I>redo</I> flag may be used.  Note
  that reprocessing clobbers the previously processed output spectra.
  <P>
  The <I>batch</I> processing option allows object spectra to be processed as
  a background or batch job.  The <I>listonly</I> option prints a summary of
  the processing steps which will be performed on the input spectra without
  actually doing anything.  This is useful for verifying which spectra will
  be affected if the input list contains previously processed spectra.  The
  listing does not include any arc spectra which may be extracted to
  dispersion calibrate an object spectrum.
  <P>
  The last parameter (excluding the task mode parameter) points to another
  parameter set for the algorithm parameters.  The way <B>dofoe</B> works
  this may not have any value and the parameter set <B>params</B> is always
  used.  The algorithm parameters are discussed further in the next section.
  <P>
  <B>Algorithms and Algorithm Parameters</B>
  <P>
  This section summarizes the various algorithms used by the <B>dofoe</B>
  task and the parameters which control and modify the algorithms.  The
  algorithm parameters available to the user are collected in the parameter
  set <B>params</B>.  These parameters are taken from the various general
  purpose tasks used by the <B>dofoe</B> processing task.  Additional
  information about these parameters and algorithms may be found in the help
  for the actual task executed.  These tasks are identified in the parameter
  section listing in parenthesis.  The aim of this parameter set organization
  is to collect all the algorithm parameters in one place separate from the
  processing parameters and include only those which are relevant for
  FOE data.  The parameter values can be changed from the
  defaults by using the parameter editor,
  <PRE>
  <P>
  	cl&gt; epar params
  <P>
  </PRE>
  or simple typing <I>params</I>.  The parameter editor can also be
  entered when editing the <B>dofoe</B> parameters by typing <I>:e
  params</I> or simply <I>:e</I> if positioned at the <I>params</I>
  parameter.
  <P>
  <B>Aperture Definitions</B>
  <P>
  The first operation is to define the extraction apertures, which include the
  aperture width, background regions, and position dependence with
  wavelength, for the object and arc orders of interest.  This is done
  on a reference spectrum which is usually a flat field taken through
  all fibers.  Other spectra will inherit the reference apertures and
  apply a correction for any shift of the orders across the dispersion.
  The reference apertures are defined only once unless the <I>redo</I>
  option is set.
  <P>
  The selected number of orders are found automatically by selecting the
  highest peaks in a cut across the dispersion.  Note that the specified
  number of orders is multiplied by two in defining the apertures when
  there is a second fiber.  Apertures
  are assigned with a limits set by the <I>lower</I> and
  <I>upper</I> parameter and numbered sequentially.  A query is then
  given allowing the aperture limits to be "<TT>resized</TT>" based on the profile
  itself (see <B>apresize</B>).
  <P>
  A cut across the orders is then shown with the apertures marked and
  an interactive aperture editing mode is entered (see <B>apedit</B>).
  For <B>dofoe</B> the aperture identifications and numbering is particularly
  critical.  When there is a single fiber the aperture numbers must
  be sequential with the order numbers.  If an order is skipped then the
  aperture number must also be skipped.
  <P>
  For dual fibers all "<TT>pairs</TT>" of object and arc orders in the region of
  interest must be defined without skipping any orders.  The orders must
  also be numbered sequentially (though the direction does not matter)
  so that the arc apertures are either all even or all odd as defined
  by the <I>arcaps</I> parameter (the default is even numbers for the
  arc apertures).  The <TT>'o'</TT> key will provide the necessary reordering.
  <P>
  If local background subtraction is used the background regions should
  also be checked with the <TT>'b'</TT> key.  Typically one adjusts all
  the background regions at the same time by selecting all apertures with
  the <TT>'a'</TT> key first.  To exit the background and aperture editing steps type
  <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  Next the positions of the orders at various points along the dispersion are
  measured and "<TT>trace functions</TT>" are fit.  The user is asked whether to fit
  each trace function interactively.  This is selected to adjust the fitting
  parameters such as function type and order.  When interactively fitting a
  query is given for each aperture.  After the first aperture one may skip
  reviewing the other traces by responding with "<TT>NO</TT>".  Queries made by
  <B>dofoe</B> generally may be answered with either lower case "<TT>yes</TT>" or "<TT>no</TT>"
  or with upper case "<TT>YES</TT>" or "<TT>NO</TT>".  The upper case responses apply to all
  further queries and so are used to eliminate further queries of that kind.
  <P>
  The above steps are all performed using tasks from the <B>apextract</B>
  package and parameters from the <B>params</B> parameters.  As a quick
  summary, the dispersion direction of the spectra are determined from the
  package <B>dispaxis</B> parameter if not defined in the image header.  The
  default line or column for finding the orders and the number of image lines
  or columns to sum are set by the <I>line</I> and <I>nsum</I> parameters.  A
  line of INDEF (the default) selects the middle of the image.  The automatic
  finding algorithm is described for the task <B>apfind</B> and basically
  finds the strongest peaks.  The resizing is described in the task
  <B>apresize</B> and the parameters used are also described there and
  identified in the PARAMETERS section.  The tracing is done as described in
  <B>aptrace</B> and consists of stepping along the image using the specified
  <I>t_step</I> parameter.  The function fitting uses the <B>icfit</B> commands
  with the other parameters from the tracing section.
  <P>
  <B>Background or Scattered Light Subtraction</B>
  <P>
  In addition to not subtracting any background scattered light there are two
  approaches to subtracting this light.  The first is to determine a smooth
  global scattered light component.  The second is to subtract a locally
  determined background at each point along the dispersion and for each
  aperture.  Note that background subtraction is only done for object images
  and not for arc images.
  <P>
  The global scattered light fitting and subtraction is done with the task
  <B>apscatter</B>.  The function fitting parameters are set interactively
  using the aperture reference spectrum.  All other subtractions are done
  noninteractively with the same set of parameters.  The scattered light is
  subtracted from the input images, thus modifying them, and one might wish
  to first make backups of the original images.
  <P>
  The scattered light is measured between the apertures using a specified
  buffer distance from the aperture edges.  The scattered light pixels are
  fit by a series of one dimensional functions across the dispersion.  The
  independent fits are then smoothed along the dispersion by again fitting
  low order functions.  These fits then define the smooth scattered light
  surface to be subtracted from the image.  The fitting parameters are
  defined and recorded in the two parameter sets <I>apscat1</I> and
  <I>apscat2</I>.  The scattered light algorithm is described more fully in
  <B>apscatter</B>.  This algorithm is relatively slow.
  <P>
  Local background subtraction is done during extraction based on background
  regions and parameters defined by the default background parameters or
  changed during interactive review of the apertures.  The background
  subtraction options are to subtract the average, median, or minimum of the
  pixels in the background regions, or to fit a function and subtract the
  function from under the extracted object pixels.  The background regions
  are specified in pixels from the aperture center and follow changes in
  center of the spectrum along the dispersion.  The syntax is colon separated
  ranges with multiple ranges separated by a comma or space.  The background
  fitting uses the <B>icfit</B> routines which include medians, iterative
  rejection of deviant points, and a choice of function types and orders.
  Note that it is important to use a method which rejects cosmic rays such as
  using either medians over all the background regions (<I>background</I> =
  "<TT>median</TT>") or median samples during fitting (<I>b_naverage</I> &lt; -1).
  The background smoothing parameter <I>b_smooth</I> is may be used
  to provide some additional local smoothing of the background light.
  The background subtraction algorithm and options are described in greater
  detail in <B>apsum</B> and <B>apbackground</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Extraction</B>
  <P>
  The actual extraction of the spectra is done by summing across the fixed
  width apertures at each point along the dispersion.  The default is to
  simply sum the pixels using partial pixels at the ends.  There is an
  option to weight the sum based on a Poisson noise model using the
  <I>readnoise</I> and <I>gain</I> detector parameters.  Note that if the
  <I>clean</I> option is selected the variance weighted extraction is used
  regardless of the <I>weights</I> parameter.  The sigma threshold for
  cleaning are also set in the <B>params</B> parameters.
  <P>
  The cleaning and variance weighting options require knowing the effective
  (i.e. accounting for any image combining) read out noise and gain.  These
  numbers need to be adjusted if the image has been processed such that the
  intensity scale has a different origin (such as a scattered light
  subtraction) or scaling (such as caused by unnormalized flat fielding).
  These options also require using background subtraction if the profile does
  not go to zero.  For optimal extraction and cleaning to work it is
  recommended that any scattered light be accounted for by local background
  subtraction rather than with the scattered light subtraction and the
  <I>fitflat</I> option be used.  The <I>b_smooth</I> parameter is also
  appropriate in this application and improves the optimal extraction results
  by reducing noise in the background signal.  For further discussion of
  cleaning and variance weighted extraction see <B>apvariance</B> and
  <B>approfiles</B> as well as  <B>apsum</B>.
  <P>
  <B>Flat Field Correction</B>
  <P>
  Flat field corrections may be made during the basic CCD processing; i.e.
  direct division by the two dimensional flat field observation.  In that
  case do not specify a flat field spectrum; use the null string "<TT></TT>".  The
  <B>dofoe</B> task provides an alternative flat field response correction
  based on division of the extracted object spectra by the extracted flat field
  spectra.  A discussion of the theory and merits of flat fielding directly
  verses using the extracted spectra will not be made here.  The
  <B>dofoe</B> flat fielding algorithm is the <I>recommended</I> method for
  flat fielding since it works well and is not subject to the many problems
  involved in two dimensional flat fielding.
  <P>
  The first step is extraction of the flat field spectrum, if one is specified,
  using the reference apertures.  Only one flat field is allowed so if
  multiple flat fields are required the data must be reduced in groups.  When
  the <I>fitflat</I> option is selected (the default) the extracted flat field
  spectra are fit by smooth functions and the ratio of the flat field spectra
  to the smooth functions define the response spectra.  The default fitting
  function and order are given by the parameters <I>f_function</I> and
  <I>f_order</I>.  If the parameter <I>f_interactive</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" then the
  fitting is done interactively using the <B>fit1d</B> task which uses the
  <B>icfit</B> interactive fitting commands.
  <P>
  If the <I>fitflat</I> option is not selected the extracted and globally
  normalized flat field spectra are directly divided in the object spectra.
  This removes the blaze function, thus altering the data counts, and
  introduces the reciprocal of the flat field spectrum in the object
  spectra.
  <P>
  The final step is to normalize the flat field spectra by the mean counts over
  all the fibers.  This normalization step is simply to preserve the average
  counts of the extracted object and arc spectra after division by the
  response spectra.
  <P>
  <B>Dispersion Correction</B>
  <P>
  If dispersion correction is not selected, <I>dispcor</I>=no, then the object
  spectra are simply extracted.  If it is selected the arc spectra are used
  to dispersion calibrate the object spectra.  There are three steps involved;
  determining the dispersion functions relating pixel position to wavelength,
  assigning the appropriate dispersion function to a particular observation,
  and either storing the nonlinear
  dispersion function in the image headers or resampling the spectra to
  evenly spaced pixels in wavelength.  When there are two fibers there is
  also a step of applying a zero point correction to the object fiber based
  on the arc fiber.
  <P>
  The first arc spectrum in the arc list is used to define the reference
  dispersion solution.  It is extracted using the reference aperture
  definitions.  Note extractions of arc spectra are not background or
  scattered light subtracted.  The interactive task <B>ecidentify</B> is used
  to define the dispersion function in one fiber.  The idea is to mark some
  lines in a few orders whose wavelengths are known (with the line list used
  to supply additional lines after the first few identifications define the
  approximate wavelengths) and to fit a function giving the wavelength from
  the aperture number and pixel position.  The dispersion function for the
  second fiber, if one is present, is then determined automatically by
  reference to the first fiber using the task <B>ecreidentify</B>.
  <P>
  The arc dispersion function parameters are for <B>ecidentify</B> and it's
  related partner <B>ecreidentify</B>.  The parameters define a line list for
  use in automatically assigning wavelengths to arc lines, a centering width
  (which should match the line widths at the base of the lines), the
  dispersion function type and orders, parameters to exclude bad lines from
  function fits, and defining whether to refit the dispersion function as
  opposed to simply determining a zero point shift.  The defaults should
  generally be adequate and the dispersion function fitting parameters may be
  altered interactively.  One should consult the help for the two tasks for
  additional details of these parameters and the interactive operation of
  <B>ecidentify</B>.
  <P>
  Once the reference dispersion functions are defined other arc spectra are
  extracted as they are assign to the object spectra.  The assignment of
  arcs is done either explicitly with an arc assignment table (parameter
  <I>arctable</I>) or based on a header parameter such as a time.
  The assignments are made by the task <B>refspectra</B>.  When two arcs are
  assigned to an object spectrum an interpolation is done between the two
  dispersion functions.  This makes an approximate correction for steady
  drifts in the dispersion.
  <P>
  When a second arc fiber monitors any zero point shifts in the dispersion
  functions it is probably only necessary to have one or two arc spectra, one
  at the beginning and/or one at the end of the night.
  <P>
  The tasks <B>setjd</B> and <B>setairmass</B> are automatically run on all
  spectra.  This computes and adds the header parameters for the Julian date
  (JD), the local Julian day number (LJD), the universal time (UTMIDDLE), and
  the air mass at the middle of the exposure.  The default arc assignment is
  to use the Julian date grouped by the local Julian day number.  The
  grouping allows multiple nights of data to be correctly assigned at the
  same time.
  <P>
  Defining the dispersion function for a new arc extraction is done with
  the task <B>ecreidentify</B>.  This is done noninteractively with log
  information recorded about the line reidentifications and the fit.
  <P>
  When there are two fibers there are two full dispersion function from the
  single or pair of arc spectra, one for the object fiber and one for the arc
  fiber.  When an object spectrum is extracted so is the simultaneous arc
  spectrum.  A zero point shift of the arc spectrum relative to the
  dispersion solution of the dual arc observation is computed using
  <B>ecreidentify</B> (<I>refit</I>=no).  This zero point shift is assumed to
  be the same for the object fiber and it is added to the dispersion function
  of the dual arc observation for the object fiber.  Note that this does not
  assume that the object and arc fiber dispersion functions are the same or
  have the same wavelength origin, but only that the same shift in wavelength
  zero point applies to both fibers.  Once the dispersion function correction
  is determined from the extracted arc fiber spectrum it is deleted leaving
  only the object spectrum.
  <P>
  The last step of dispersion correction is setting the dispersion
  of the object spectrum.  There are two choices here.
  If the <I>linearize</I> parameter is not set the nonlinear dispersion
  function is stored in the image header.  Other IRAF tasks interpret
  this information when dispersion coordinates are needed for plotting
  or analysis.  This has the advantage of not requiring the spectra
  to be interpolated and the disadvantage that the dispersion
  information is only understood by IRAF tasks and cannot be readily
  exported to other analysis software.
  <P>
  If the <I>linearize</I> parameter is set then the spectra are resampled to a
  linear dispersion relation either in wavelength or the log of the
  wavelength.  For echelle spectra each order is linearized independently so
  that the wavelength interval per pixel is different in different orders.
  This preserves most of the resolution and avoids over or under sampling of
  the highest or lowest dispersion orders.  The wavelength limits are
  taken from the limits determined from the arc reference spectrum and
  the number of pixels is the same as the original images.  The dispersion
  per pixel is then derived from these constraints.
  <P>
  The linearization algorithm  parameters allow selecting the interpolation
  function type, whether to conserve flux per pixel by integrating across the
  extent of the final pixel, and whether to linearize to equal linear or
  logarithmic intervals.  The latter may be appropriate for radial velocity
  studies.  The default is to use a fifth order polynomial for interpolation,
  to conserve flux, and to not use logarithmic wavelength bins.  These
  parameters are described fully in the help for the task <B>dispcor</B> which
  performs the correction.
