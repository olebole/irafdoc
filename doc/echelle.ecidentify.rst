  Emission and absorption features in echelle format spectra (see <I>apsum</I>)
  are identified interactively and from a line list and a dispersion
  function is determined.  The results of the line identifications and
  dispersion function are stored in a database for further reference and
  for use with the tasks <B>ecreidentify</B> and <B>ecdispcor</B>.  Also
  the reference spectrum keyword REFSPEC is added to the image header.
  This is used by <B>refspectra</B> and <B>ecdispcor</B>.
  <P>
  Each spectrum in the input list is identified in turn.  Initially the
  order in the first image line is graphed.  The user may change the
  displayed order with the <TT>'j'</TT>, <TT>'k'</TT>, and <TT>'o'</TT> keys.  The initial feature
  list and dispersion function are read from the database if an entry
  exists.  The features are marked on the graph.  The image coordinates
  are in pixels unless a dispersion function is defined, in which case
  they are in user coordinate units (usually wavelength in Angstroms).
  The aperture number, pixel coordinate, coordinate function value, and
  user coordinate for the current feature are displayed on the status
  line.
  <P>
  For consistency the orders are always identified by their aperture
  numbers in this task and all other tasks.  These are the
  identifications assigned when extracting the orders using the task
  <I>apsum</I>.  If the user has assigned true order numbers as the
  aperture numbers then there is no distinction between aperture and
  order number.  However, it is often the case that the aperture numbers
  are simply assigned sequentially and the true order numbers may not
  even be known.  Initially the orders are the same as the apertures
  numbers but after fitting a dispersion function the true order numbers
  will be determined.  This information is also recorded in the database
  and indicated in the graph titles but selecting an order to be graphed
  with <TT>'o'</TT> and the status line information is always in terms of the
  aperture number.
  <P>
  The graphics cursor is used to select features and perform various
  functions.  A menu of the keystroke options and functions is printed
  with the key <TT>'?'</TT>.  The cursor keys and their functions are defined in
  the CURSOR KEYS sections and described further below.  The standard
  cursor mode keys are also available to window and redraw the graph and
  to produce hardcopy "<TT>snaps</TT>".
  <P>
  There are two types of feature selection functions;  defining new
  features and selecting previously defined features.  The key <TT>'m'</TT> marks
  a new feature nearest the cursor position.  The feature position is
  determined by the feature centering algorithm (see help for
  <B>center1d</B>).  The type of feature, emission or absorption, is set
  by the <I>ftype</I> parameter.  If the new position is within a distance
  given by the parameter <I>minsep</I> of a previous feature it is
  considered to be the same feature and replaces the old feature
  (normally the position of the new feature will be exactly the same as
  the original feature).  The coordinate list is searched for a match
  between the coordinate function value (when defined) and a user
  coordinate in the list.  If a match is found it becomes the default
  user coordinate which the user may override.  The new feature is marked
  on the graph and it becomes the current feature.  The redefinition of a
  feature which is within the minimum separation may be used to set the
  user coordinate from the coordinate list.  The key <TT>'t'</TT> allows setting
  the position of a feature to other than that found by the centering
  algorithm.
  <P>
  The <TT>'y'</TT> key applies a peak finding algorithm and up to the maximum
  number of features (<I>maxfeatures</I>) are found.  If there are more
  peaks only the strongest are kept.  The peaks are then matched against
  the coordinate list to find user coordinate values.
  <P>
  To select a different feature as the current feature the keys <TT>'.'</TT>, <TT>'n'</TT>,
  <TT>'+'</TT>, and <TT>'-'</TT> are used.  The <TT>'.'</TT> selects the feature nearest the cursor,
  the <TT>'n'</TT> and <TT>'+'</TT> select the next feature, and the <TT>'-'</TT> selects the
  previous feature relative to the current feature in the feature list as
  ordered by pixel coordinate.  These keys are useful when redefining the
  user coordinate with the <TT>'u'</TT> key and when examining features in zoom
  mode.  To change apertures (orders) the <TT>'j'</TT>, <TT>'k'</TT>, and <TT>'o'</TT> keys are
  used.
  <P>
  If four or more features are identified spanning the range of the data
  (in pixel coordinates and in order number) or if a coordinate function
  is defined then the <TT>'l'</TT> key may be used to identify additional features
  from a coordinate list.  If a coordinate function is not defined the
  default function is fit to the user coordinates of the currently
  defined features.  Then for each coordinate value in the coordinate
  list the pixel coordinate is determined and a search for a feature at
  that point is made.  If a feature is found (based on the parameters
  <I>ftype, fwidth</I>, <I>cradius</I>, and <B>threshold</B>) its user
  coordinate value based on the coordinate function is determined.  If
  the coordinate function value matches the user coordinate from the
  coordinate list within the error limit set by the parameter <I>match</I>
  then the new feature is entered in the feature list.  Up to a maximum
  number of features, set by the parameter <I>maxfeatures</I>, may be
  defined in this way.  A new user coordinate function is fit to all the
  located features.  Finally, the graph is redrawn in user coordinates
  with the additional features found from the coordinate list marked.
  <P>
  The <TT>'f'</TT> key fits a two dimensional function of the pixel coordinates
  and aperture number to the user coordinates.  The type of function and
  the orders are initially set with the parameters <I>function</I>,
  <I>xorder</I>, and <I>yorder</I>.  The value of the function for a
  particular pixel coordinate is called the function coordinate and each
  feature in the feature list has a function coordinate value.  The
  fitted function also is used to convert pixel coordinates to user
  coordinates in the graph.  Depending on the orders of the function
  four or more features are required covering at least two orders.
  A description of the dispersion function fitting is given the section
  ECHELLE DISPERSION FUNCTION FITTING.
  <P>
  If a zero point shift is desired without changing the coordinate function
  the user may specify the coordinate of a point in the spectrum with
  the <TT>'s'</TT> key from which a shift is determined.  The <TT>'g'</TT> key also
  determines a shift by minimizing the difference between the user
  coordinates and the fitted coordinates.  This is used when a previously
  determined coordinate function is applied to a new spectrum having
  fewer or poorer lines and only a zero point shift can reasonably be
  determined.  Note that the zero point shift is in user coordinates
  for the fundamental order.  The shift for any particular order is then
  the zero point shift divided by the order number.
  <P>
  Features may be delete with the key <TT>'d'</TT>.  All features are deleted when
  the <TT>'a'</TT> key immediately precedes the delete key.  Deleting the features
  does not delete the coordinate function.  To delete both the features
  and the dispersion function the initialize key <TT>'i'</TT> is used.  Note
  features deleted during dispersion function fitting also are removed
  from the feature list upon exiting the fitting package.
  <P>
  It is common to transfer the feature identifications and coordinate
  function from one image to another.  When a new image without a
  database entry is examined, such as when going to the next image in the
  input list or selecting a new image with the "<TT>:image</TT>" command, the
  current feature list and coordinate function are kept.  Alternatively,
  a database record from a different image may be read with the "<TT>:read</TT>"
  command.  When transferring feature identifications between images the
  feature coordinates will not agree exactly with the new image feature
  positions and several options are available to reregister the feature
  positions.  The key <TT>'c'</TT> centers the feature nearest the cursor using
  the current position as the starting point.  When preceded with the <TT>'a'</TT>
  key all the features are recentered (the user must refit the coordinate
  function if desired).  As an aside, the recentering function is also
  useful when the parameters governing the feature centering algorithm
  are changed.
  <P>
  The (c)entering function is applicable when the shift between the
  current and true feature positions is small.  Larger shifts may be
  determined automatically with the <TT>'x'</TT> function which correlates
  features in the image with the feature list.  The features are then
  recentered.  A zero point shift may also be given interactively with
  the <TT>'s'</TT> key by using the cursor to indicate the coordinate of a point
  in the spectrum.  If there are no features then the shift is exactly as
  marked by the cursor but if there are features the approximate shift is
  applied and then the features are recentered.  The shift is then the
  mean shift of the features after recentering.  The shift is used as a
  zero point offset added to the dispersion function.  The shift is
  computed in user coordinates for the fundamental order.  Shifts for
  each order are given by scaling of this shift.
  <P>
  In addition to the single keystroke commands there are commands
  initiated by the key <TT>':'</TT> (colon commands).  As with the keystroke
  commands there are a number of standard graphics features available
  begining with "<TT>:.</TT>" (type "<TT>:.help</TT>" for these commands).  The colon
  commands allow the task parameter values to be listed and to be reset
  within the task.  A parameter is listed by typing its name.  The colon
  command "<TT>:show</TT>" lists all the parameters.  A parameter value is reset
  by typing the parameter name followed by the new value; for example
  "<TT>:match 10</TT>".  Other colon commands display the feature list
  (:features), control reading and writing records to the database (:read
  and :write), and set the graph display format.
  <P>
  The feature identification process for an image is completed by typing
  <TT>'q'</TT> to quit.  Attempting to quit an image without explicitly recording
  changes in the feature database produces a warning message and an
  opportunity to record the information in the database.  As an immediate
  exit the <TT>'I'</TT> interrupt key may be used.  This does not save the feature
  information.

  <! BeginSection: 'ECHELLE DISPERSION FUNCTION FITTING'>
  <UL>
  If a minimum of four features over at least two orders, depending on
  the default function orders, have been identified a dispersion function
  relating the user coordinates to the extracted pixel coordinate and
  aperture number may be fit.  However, more features are preferable to
  determine changes in the dispersion as a function of position and
  order.
  <P>
  The form of the function fit explicitly includes the basic order number
  dependence of echelle spectra; namely the wavelength of a particular
  point along the dispersion direction in different orders varies as the
  reciprocal of the order number.  Because of distortions, the differing
  extraction paths through the two dimensional image, and rotations of
  the spectra relative to the axis of constant dispersion (i.e. aligning
  the orders with the image columns or lines instead of aligning the
  emission and absorption features) there will be residual dependancies on
  the extracted pixel positions and orders.  These residual dependancies
  are fit by a two dimensional polynomial of arbitrary order including
  cross terms.  Because the basic order number dependence has been
  removed the orders should be relatively low.  Currently the functions
  are bi-dimensional chebyshev and legendre polynomials though other
  function may be added in the future.
  <P>
  Since the true order number may not be known initially a linear
  relation between the aperture numbers and the order numbers is also
  determined which minimizes the residuals.  This relation allows an
  unknown offset and possible a reversed direction of increasing order.
  The fitted function is then represented as:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  		y = offset +/- aperture
  <P>
  		wavelength = f (x, y) / y
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where y is the order number and x is the extracted pixel coordinate along the
  dispersion.
   
  If the order offset is known initially or as a result of previous the <TT>'o'</TT>
  fit may be used.  The dispersion minimization for the order offset is
  then not done.  This will, therefore, be faster than using the full
  fit, key <TT>'f'</TT>, to also determine the order offset.
  <P>
  The fitting is done interactively as a submode of <B>ecidentify</B> with its
  own set of cursor commands.  It is entered using the <TT>'f'</TT> key and exited using
  the <TT>'q'</TT> key.  The list of commands is given the CURSOR KEY section and is
  available from the fitting mode with <TT>'?'</TT>.  The functionality of this fitting
  is fairly simple; the function and orders may be changed, points may be deleted
  and undeleted, and the results of the fit may be displayed in various formats
  by selecting quantities to be plotted along either axis.  Generally one
  changes plotting of the pixel coordinate, order number, and wavelength
  along the x axis and residuals or radial velocity errors along the y axis.
  One switches between increasing the x order and the y order while switching
  between plotting verses x positions and order number until the residuals
  have been reduced to remove all systematic trends.
