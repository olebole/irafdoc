  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  Flat fields are created containing only the small scale variations in the
  calibration images.  The large scale variations in the images are modeled
  by fitting a function to each image line or column with deviant pixel rejection.
  The flat field values are obtained by taking the ratio of the image values
  to the function fit.  However, if the fitted value is less than the
  parameter <I>minflat</I> the flat field value is set to unity.
  <P>
  The function fitting parameters may be set interactively when the interactive
  flag is set using the interactive curve fitting package <B>icfit</B>.
  The cursor mode commands for this package are described in a separate
  help entry under "<TT>icfit</TT>".  For two dimensional images the user is
  prompted for the sample line or column or a blank-separated range to be
  averaged and graphed.
  Note that the lines or columns are relative the input image section; for
  example line 1 is the first line of the image section and not the first
  line of the image.  Any number of lines or columns may be examined.
  When satisfied with the fit parameters the user
  responds with a carriage return to the line or column prompt.
  The function is then fit to all the lines or columns and the flat field
  ratios are determined.
  <P>
  If the output image does not exist initially it is created with the same
  size as the input image <I>without</I> an image section and initialized
  to unit response.  Subsequently the flat field data modifies the pixel
  values in the output image.  Input image sections may be used to restrict
  the region in which the flat field response is determined leaving the
  rest of the output image unmodified.  This ability is particularly useful
  when dealing with multi-aperture data.
  <P>
  This task is very similar to <B>fit1d</B> with the addition of the
  parameter <I>minflat</I> and the deletion of the parameter <I>type</I>
  which is always "<TT>ratio</TT>".

  1.  Create a flat field from the calibration image "<TT>quartz</TT>" with the
  spectrum running along the lines.  Exclude the first and last columns,
  use a spline fit of 25 pieces (a width of 32 pixels over 800 columns),
  and set grow to 4 pixels.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; flat1d quartz flat order=25 sample="2:799" grow=4 \<BR>
  	&gt;&gt;&gt; interactive=no
  <P>
  			or
  <P>
  	cl&gt; flat1d quartz[2:799,*] flat order=25 grow=4 inter-
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The fitting parameters may be set interactively in which case the fitting
  parameters need not be specified.  The command would be
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; flat1d quartz flat
  	quartz: Fit column = 1 10
  	quartz: Fit column =
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The user selects sample columns to be fit interactively with the interactive
  curve fitting package.  When satisfied with the fit parameters
  respond with a carriage return to the prompt.  The function is then fit to
  all the columns and the flat field ratios are determined.
  <P>
  2.  As an example for multi-slit spectra the locations of the slits are
  determined and a file containing the image sections is created.
  Since there must be the same number of output images another file
  containing the output images is also created.  For
  example the files might contain
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	  File quartzs			File flats
  	_______________			__________
  	quartz[23:40,*]			   flat
  	quartz[55:61,*]			   flat
  	quartz[73:84,*]			   flat
  </PRE>
  <P>
  A flat field for the slits is then obtained with the command
  <P>
  	cl&gt; flat1d @quartzs flats axis=2

  The creation of multi-slit files and the need for an equal number of
  repeated output files is annoying.  It will be worked on in the future.
