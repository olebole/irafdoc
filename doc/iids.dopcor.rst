  The input spectra (as specified by the input image list and apertures) are
  corrected by removing a specified doppler shift and written to the
  specified output images.  The correction is such that if the actual
  shift of the observed object is specified then the corrected spectra
  will be the rest spectra.  The opposite sign for a velocity or the
  redshift complement (1/(1+z)-1) may be used to add a doppler shift
  to a spectrum.
  <P>
  There are two common usages.  One is to take spectra with high doppler
  velocities, such as cosmological sources, and correct them to rest with
  respect to the earth.  In this case the measured redshift or velocity is
  specified to "<TT>remove</TT>" this component.  The other usage is to correct
  spectra to heliocentric or local standard of rest.  The heliocentric or LSR
  velocities can be computed and entered in the image header with the task
  <B>rvcorrect</B>.  In this case it is tempting to again think you are
  "<TT>removing</TT>" the velocity so that you specify the velocity as given in the
  header.  But actually what is needed is to "<TT>add</TT>" the computed standard of
  rest velocity to the observed spectrum taken with respect to the telescope
  to place the dispersion in the desired center of rest.  Thus, in this case
  you specify the opposite of the computed heliocentric or LSR velocity; i.e.
  use a negative.
  <P>
  The redshift or space velocity in km/s is specified either as a number or
  as an image header keyword containing the velocity or redshift.  If a
  number is given it applies to all the input spectra while an image header
  keyword may differ for each image.  The latter method of specifying a
  velocity is useful if velocity corrections are recorded in the image
  header.  See <B>rvcorrect</B> for example.
  <P>
  The choice between a redshift and a space velocity for the <I>redshift</I>
  parameter is made using the <I>isvelocity</I> parameter. If isvelocity=yes
  then the header dispersion solution is modified according to the
  relativistic Doppler correction:
  <P>
  	lambda_new = lamda_old * sqrt((1 + v/c)/(1 - v/c))
  <P>
  where v is the value of "<TT>redshift</TT>".  If isvelocity=no, <I>redshift</I> is
  interpreted as a cosmological redshift and the header dispersion solution
  is modified to give:
  <P>
  	lambda_new = lamda_old * z
  <P>
  where z is the value of "<TT>redshift</TT>"
  <P>
  If the <I>add</I> parameter is used and the image uses a "<TT>multispec</TT>"
  format where the previous doppler factor is stored separately
  then the new doppler factor is:
  <P>
  	znew = (1 + z) * (1 + zold) - 1 = z + zold + z * zold
  <P>
  where z is the specified doppler factor, zold is the previous one,
  and znew is the final doppler factor.  If the <I>add</I> parameter
  is no then the previous correction is replaced by the new correction.
  Note that for images using a linear or equispec coordinate system
  the corrections are always additive since a record is not kept of
  the previous correction.  Also any flux correction is made based
  on the specified doppler correction rather than znew.
  <P>
  There are two corrections which may be made and the user selects one
  or both of these.  A correction to the dispersion function is selected
  with the <I>dispersion</I> parameter.  This correction is a term to be
  applied to the dispersion coordinates defined for the image.  <I>The spectrum
  is not resampled, only the dispersion coordinate function is affected</I>.
  A correction to the flux, pixel values, is selected with the <I>flux</I>
  parameter.  This correction is only significant for cosmological redshifts.
  As such the correction is dependent on a cosmological model as well as
  whether a total flux or surface brightness is measured.  To provide the
  range of possible corrections the flux correction factor is defined by
  the <I>factor</I> parameter as the power of 1+z (where z is the
  redshift) to be multiplied into the observed pixel values.
  <P>
  A keyword DOPCORnn is added to the image header.  The index starts from
  01 and increments if multiple corrections are applied.  The value of
  the keywords gives the redshift applied, the flux factor if used, and
  the apertures which were corrected.

  2.  To correct a set of spectra (in place) to heliocentric rest the task
  <B>rvcorrect</B> is used to set the VHELIO keyword using an observed
  velocity of 0.  Then:

  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; dopcor *.imh "" -vhelio isvel+

  3.  To artificially add a redshift of 3.2 to a spectrum the complementary
  redshift is computed:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; = 1/(1+3.2)-1
  	-0.76190476190476
  	cl&gt; dopcor artspec "" -0.762 flux+
