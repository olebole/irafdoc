  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  The input spectra are divided by the flat fields which are
  represented by spectra produced by FLATFIT.
  <P>
  To avoid possible division by zero, any zeroes in the flat field
  spectra generated by FLATFIT are replaced by 1.0.
  <P>
  The input spectra may optionally be corrected for coincidence losses.
  <P>
  If the input and output spectra (after appending the record numbers) are
  the same then the division is performed in-place; i.e. the flattened spectra
  replace the original input spectra.
  Note that even if an output image is not created because the input
  image has already been flattened or the input image is not found the
  output record number is still incremented.  This is to insure that if
  in-place division is desired that the input and output names remain
  matched.

  The following example divides a series of spectra to produce 20 new
  spectra having names nite1.1221 ... nite1.1240.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; flatdiv nite1 1201-1220 nite1 1221
  <P>
  The same spectra as above are simultaneously corrected for
  coincidence losses.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; flatdiv nite1 1201-1220 nite1 1221 coincor=yes
  <P>
  The flattened spectra replace the unflattened spectra.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; flatdiv nite1 1201-1220 nite1 1201
  <P>
  Note that the input record numbers must be contiguous and the starting
  output record number must be the same as the first input record number.
