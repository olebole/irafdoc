  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  Standard star calibration measurements are used to determine the system
  sensitivity as a function of wavelength for each independent aperture.
  If the parameter <I>ignoreaps</I> is set then the aperture numbers are
  ignored and a single sensitivity function is determined from all the
  observations.  Using measurements spanning a range of airmass it is
  also possible to derive an adjustment to the standard extinction curve
  or even an absolute determination.  Extinction determination requires
  that the observations span a good range of airmass during photometric
  conditions.  When conditions are poor and standard star observations
  are obtained during periods of variable transparency, the entire
  sensitivity curve may vary by a constant factor, assuming that the
  cause of the variations has no color effect.  This is often the case
  during periods of thin clouds.  In this case the mean sensitivity of
  each observation may be shifted to match the observation of greatest
  sensitivity.  This allows for the possibility of deriving correct
  absolute fluxes if one observation of a standard was obtained during a
  clear period.
  <P>
  The input data is a file of calibration information produced by the
  task <B>standard</B>.  The data consists of a spectrum identification
  line containing the spectrum image name, the sky image name if beam
  switching, the aperture number, the length of the spectrum, the
  exposure time, airmass, wavelength range, and title.  Following the
  identification line are calibration lines consisting of the central
  bandpass wavelengths, the tabulated fluxes in the bandpasses, the
  bandpass widths, and the observed counts in the bandpasses.  The
  spectrum identification and calibration lines repeat for each standard
  star observation.  The parameter <I>apertures</I> may be used to select
  only specific apertures from the input data.  This parameter is in the
  form of a range list (see help for <B>ranges</B>) and if no list is
  given (specified by the null string "<TT></TT>") then all apertures are selected.
  <P>
  An input extinction file may also be specified.  Any extinction
  determinations are then residuals to this input extinction table.
  The format of this table is described in <B>lcalib</B>.
  <P>
  The calibration factor at each point is computed as
  <P>
  	(1) C = 2.5 log (O / (T B F)) + A E
  <P>
  where O is the observed counts in a bandpass of an observation,
  T is the exposure time of the observation, B is the bandpass width,
  F is the flux per Angstrom at the bandpass for the standard star,
  A is the airmass of the observation, and E is the extinction
  at the bandpass.  Thus, C is the ratio of the observed count rate per
  Angstrom corrected to some extinction curve to the expected flux
  expressed in magnitudes.  The goal of the task is to fit the observations
  to the relation
  <P>
  	(2) C = S(W) + AE(W)
  <P>
  where W is wavelength, S(W) is the sensitivity function, and E(W) is
  a residual extinction function relative to the extinction used in (1).
  In later discussion we will also refer to the residual sensitivity which
  is defined by
  <P>
  	(3) R = C - S(W) - AE(W)
  <P>
  The sensitivity function S(W) is output as an one dimensional image
  much like the spectra.  The sensitivities are in magnitude units to
  better judge the variations and because the interpolation is smoother
  in the logarithmic space (mags = 2.5 log10[sensitivity]).  There is one
  sensitivity function for each aperture unless the parameter
  <I>ignoreaps</I> is set.  In the first case the image names are formed
  from the specified rootname with the aperture number as a four digit
  numerical extension.  In the latter case a single sensitivity function
  is determined from all data, ignoring the aperture numbers, and the
  specified output image is created without an extension.  These images
  are used by <B>calibrate</B> to correct observations to a relative of
  absolute flux scale.  If no sensitivity function image rootname is
  specified then the sensitivity curves are not output.
  <P>
  If a revised extinction function E(W) has been determined for one or
  more of the apertures then the functions are averaged over all
  apertures, added to the original extinction, and written to the
  specified extinction table.  The format of this table is the same as
  the standard extinction tables and are, thus, interchangeable.  If no
  new extinction filename is specified then no extinction table is
  recorded.
  <P>
  If a log filename is given then statistical information about the
  sensitivity function determinations are recorded.  This includes the
  names of the input standard star observations and the tabulated
  sensitivity, extinction, and error information.
  <P>
  Some points to note are that if no input extinction is given then the
  E in (1) are zero and the E determined in (2) is the absolute extinction.
  If the data are not good enough to determine extinction then using one
  of the standard extinction curves the problem reduces to fitting
  <P>
  	(4) C = S(W)
  <P>
  The sensitivity and extinction functions are determined as fitted
  curves.  The curves are defined by a function type and order.  There
  are four function types and the order specifies either the number of
  terms in the polynomial or the number of pieces in the spline.  The
  order is automatically reduced to the largest
  value which produces a nonsingular result.  In this case the function
  will attempt to pass through every calibration point.  Lower orders
  provide for a smoother representation of the function.  The latter
  is generally more appropriate for a detector.  The initial function
  type and order for the sensitivity function is specified by the
  parameters <I>function</I> and <I>order</I>.
  <P>
  If the <I>interactive</I> flag is no then the default function and order
  is fit to equation (4) (i.e. there is no residual extinction determination
  or manipulation of the data).  The sensitivity functions are output
  if an image rootname is given and the log information is output if a
  log filename is given.
  <P>
  When the sensitivity is determined interactively a query is given for
  each aperture.  The responses "<TT>no</TT>" and "<TT>yes</TT>" select fitting the sensitivity
  interactively or not for the specified aperture.  The responses "<TT>NO</TT>" and
  "<TT>YES</TT>" apply to all apertures and no further queries will be given.
  When interactive fitting is selected the data are graphed
  on the specified graphics device and input is through the specified
  cursor list.  The graphics output consists of from one to four graphs.
  The user selects how many and which types of graphs to display.  The
  graph types and their single character code used to select them are:
  <P>
  <PRE>
     a - residual sensitivity vs airmass
     c - composite residual sensitivity and error bars vs wavelength
     e - input extinction and revised extinction vs wavelength
     i - Flux calibrated spectrum vs wavelength
     r - residual sensitivity vs wavelength
     s - sensitivity vs wavelength
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The initial graphs are selected with the parameter <B>graphs</B> and changed
  interactively with the colon command ':graphs <I>types</I>'.  The ability
  to view a variety of graphs allows evaluating the effects of the
  sensitivity curve and extinction in various ways.  The flux calibrated
  spectrum graph uses the current sensitivity function and checks for
  possible wiggles in the sensitivity curve which affect the shape of the
  continuum.  The choice of graphs also allows the
  user to trade off plotting speed and resolution against the amount of
  information available simultaneously.  Thus, with some graphics devices
  or over a slow line one can reduce the number of graphs for greater speed
  while on very fast devices with large screens one can look at more
  data.  The parameter <I>marks</I> and the associated colon command
  ':marks <I>types</I>' also let the user define the symbols used to mark
  included, deleted, and added data points.
  <P>
  The list of interactive commands in given in the section on CURSOR COMMANDS.
  The commands include deleting, undeleting, adding, moving, and identifying
  individual data points, whole stars, or all points at the same wavelength.
  Some other commands include <TT>'c'</TT> to create composite points by averaging
  all points at the same wavelength (this requires exact overlap in the
  bandpasses) which then replace the individual data points in the fit.
  This is different than the composite point graph which displays the
  residual in the mean sensitivity
  and error <I>in the mean</I> but uses the input data in the fitting.
  The <TT>'s'</TT> command shifts the data so that the mean sensitivity of each
  star is the same as the star with the greatest mean sensitivity.
  This compensates for variable grey extinction due to clouds.  Note
  that delete points are excluded from the shift calculation and a
  deleted star will not be used as the star of greatest sensitivity.
  Another useful command is <TT>'o'</TT> to recover the original data.  This cancels
  all changes made due to shifting, extinction corrections, deleting points,
  creating composite points, etc.
  <P>
  The <TT>'e'</TT> command attempts to compute a residual extinction by finding
  correlations between the sensitivity points at different airmass.
  Note that this is not iterative so that repeating this after having
  added an extinction correction simply redetermines the correction.
  At each wavelength or wavelength regions having multiple observations at
  different airmass a slope with airmass is determined.  This slope is
  the residual extinction at that wavelength.  A plot of the residual
  extinctions at each wavelength is made using the ICFIT procedure.
  The user may then examine and fit a curve through the residual extinction
  estimates as a function of wavelength (see <B>icfit</B> for a description
  of the commands).  The user must decide how much wavelength dependence
  is derivable from the data.  In many cases only a constant fit
  to a "<TT>gray extinction</TT>" or possibly a linear fit is realistic.
  The fitting is exited by the key <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  To help evaluate how important the residual extinction determination
  is a t-statistic significance is computed.  This statistic is defined by
  <P>
  	(5) t = sqrt (r**2 * (N - 2) / (1 - r**2))
  <P>
  where the correlation coefficient
  <P>
  	(6) r = RMS with correction / RMS without correction
  <P>
  is the fractional improvement in the RMS due to the added extinction
  correction and N is the number of wavelength points.  For large
  N this approaches a gaussian sigma but a more precise significance
  requires the t-distribution for N-2 degrees of freedom.  Basically this
  asks, was the improvement in the RMS significantly more than would
  occur with random errors?  A value greater than 3 is good while
  a value less than 1 is not significant.  The user may then accept the
  revised extinction and apply it to the data.
  <P>
  Note that when there are multiple apertures used each aperture has an
  independent system sensitivity but the residual extinction is the same.
  Therefore, the residual extinctions from each aperture are averaged at
  the end.  If one determines a new extinction then one may replace the
  original input extinction by the new extinction and rederive the
  sensitivity.
