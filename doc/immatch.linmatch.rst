  LINMATCH computes the bscale and bzero factors required to match
  the intensity scales of a list of input
  images <I>input</I> to the intensity scales of a list of reference
  images <I>reference</I> using the following definition of
  bscale and bzero and a variety of techniques.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	reference = bscale * input + bzero
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The computed bscale and bzero factors are stored
  in the text file <I>lintransform</I>, in the record <I>records</I> if
  <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", or a single line of a simple text file
  if <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>no</TT>". One record is written to the output file
  file for each input image. If a non NULL list of output images
  <I>output</I> is supplied, a scaled output image is written for
  each input image. LINMATCH is intended to solve 1D and 2D image intensity
  matching problems where the input and reference images: 1) have the same
  pixel scale and orientation, 2) differ in intensity by at most a scale
  factor and a zero point, and 3) contain one or more regions or objects in
  common that can be used to compute the scaling factors. Some of the scaling
  algorithms also require that the images registered and have identical
  point spread functions. LINMATCH cannot be used to compute or apply non-linear
  intensity matching functions.
  <P>
  If <I>scaling</I> = "<TT>mean</TT>", "<TT>median</TT>", "<TT>mode</TT>", or "<TT>fit</TT>" bscale and bzero
  are computed directly from the input and reference image data using the
  image sections specified in the <I>regions</I> and one of the above fitting
  techniques as described in the ALGORITHMS section. All four algorithms
  require accurate knowledge of the measurement errors which in turn
  require accurate knowledge of the input and reference image gain and
  readout noise values. Gain and readout noise values can be entered by
  setting the <I>gain</I> and <I>readnouse</I> parameters to the appropriate
  numerical values or image header keyword.
  <P>
  <I>Regions</I> is interpreted as either: 1) a string of
  the form "<TT>grid nx ny</TT>" specifying a list of nx by ny image sections
  spanning the entire image, 2) a string defining the coordinates of a list
  of objects separated by commas e.g.
  "<TT>103.3 189.2, 204.4 389.7</TT>", 3) a string containing a list of image
  sections separated by whitespace, e.g "<TT>[100:203,200:300] [400:500,400:500]</TT>"
  4) the name of a text file containing the coordinates of one or
  more objects, one object per line, with the x and y coordinates
  in columns 1 and 2 respectively, 5) the name of a text
  file containing a list of image sections separated by whitespace and/or
  newlines.  The image sections specifications, or alternatively
  the object coordinates and the parameters <I>dnx</I> and <I>dny</I>,
  determine the size of the input and reference image data regions to be
  extracted and used to compute the bscale and bzero factors.
  These image regions should be selected with care. Ideal regions
  span a range of intensity values and contain both object and background
  data. 
  <P>
  If <I>scaling</I> = "<TT>photometry</TT>", the bscale and bzero factors
  are computed directly from data in the input and reference image photometry
  files using the technique described in the ALGORITHMS section.
  In this case <I>regions</I> is a list of the input image photometry
  files and <I>reference</I> are the corresponding reference image
  photometry files written by a separate photometry task.
  These photometry files are simple text files with the object
  sky values, errors in the sky values, magnitudes, and errors in the
  magnitudes in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
  <P>
  An image region is rejected from the fit if it contains data outside the
  limits specified by the <I>datamin</I> and <I>datamax</I> parameters
  and <I>scaling</I> =
  "<TT>mean</TT>", "<TT>median</TT>", or "<TT>mode</TT>". A pixel is rejected from the fit for an
  individual region if the pixel value is outside the limits specified
  by datamin and datamax, and the scaling algorithm is "<TT>fit</TT>". The datamin
  and datamax parameters are not used by the "<TT>photometry</TT>" scaling algorithm .
  <P>
  Deviant pixels can be rejected from the fits to individual image regions
  if <I>scaling</I> = "<TT>fit</TT>", and <I>nreject</I>, <I>loreject</I>, and
  <I>hireject</I> are set appropriately. Nreject, loreject and reject
  are also be used by all the scaling algorithms  to reject image regions
  which contribute deviant bscale and bzero values.
  <P>
  The computed bscale and bzero value for each region and the final bscale 
  and bzero value for each input image are written to the linear
  transformation file <I>lintransform</I>.
  If <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" each result is written to a record whose name
  is either identical to the name of the input
  image or supplied by the user via the <I>records</I> parameter .
  If <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>no</TT>", then a single line containing the input image
  name and the computed bscale and bzero values and their errors
  is written to the output shifts file.
  <P>
  If a list of output image names have been supplied then the bscale and
  bzero values will be applied to the input images to compute the output images.
  <P>
  If the <I>scaling</I> parameter is set to "<TT>file</TT>" then the shifts
  computed in a previous run of LINMATCH will be read from the <I>lintransform</I>
  file and applied to the input images to compute the output images.
  If no record list is supplied by the user LINMATCH will
  search for a record whose name is the same as the input image name. If more than
  one record of the same name is found then the most recently written
  record will be used.
  <P>
  In non-interactive mode the task parameters are set at task startup time
  and the input images are processed sequentially. If the <I>verbose</I>
  flag is set, messages about the progress of the task are printed on the
  screen as the task is running.
  <P>
  In interactive mode the user can mark the regions to be used
  to compute the matching function on the image display, show/set the data
  and algorithm parameters, compute, recompute,  and plot 
  matching function, and interactively delete and undelete
  bad data from the fits using the plots and graphics cursor. A summary

  If more than one image region is defined then the computed mean, median,
  or mode values for the input and reference image regions are used as
  shown below to compute the bscale and bzero factors and their errors
  using a weighted least squares fit.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	mstat[ref] = bscale * mstat[input] + bzero
  </PRE>
  <P>
  If an image region contains data outside the limits defined
  by <I>datamin</I> and <I>datamax</I> that image region is eliminated
  entirely from the fit.
  <P>
  The parameters <I>nreject</I>, <I>loreject</I>,
  and <I>hireject</I> are used to detect and automatically eliminate
  deviant data points from the final least squares fit. If for some reason
  bscale or bzero cannot be fit, default values of 1.0 and 0.0 are
  assigned.
  <P>
  The mean, median, and mode algorithms depend on the global properties of
  the image regions. These algorithms do require the reference and
  input images to have the same pixel scale and orientation,
  but do not automatically require the reference and input images
  to have the same point spread function. Small shifts between the reference
  and input images can be removed using the <I>shifts</I>, <I>xshift</I>, and
  <I>yshift</I> parameters.
  <P>
  If the image regions contain stars, then either regions should be large
  enough to include all the flux of the stars in which case the images
  do not have to have the same psf, or the psfs should be the same so
  that same portion of the psf is sampled. The best image regions for
  matching will contain object and background information.
  <P>
  FIT
  <P>
  For each input and reference image the bscale and bzero factors are
  computed by doing a pixel to pixel weighted least squares fit of the reference
  image counts to the input image counts as shown below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
      counts[ref] = bscale * counts[input] + bzero
           weight = 1.0 / (err[ref] ** 2 + bscale ** 2 * err[input] ** 2)
         err[ref] = sqrt (counts[ref] / gain[ref] + readnoise[ref] ** 2 /
                    gain[ref] ** 2)
       err[input] = sqrt (counts[input] / gain[input] +
       		  readnoise[input] ** 2 / gain[input] ** 2)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The fitting technique takes into account errors in both the reference and
  input image counts and provides an error estimate for the computed bscale
  and bzero factors. Bad data are rejected
  automatically from the fit by setting the <I>datamin</I> and <I>datamax</I>
  parameters. Deviant pixels are rejected from the fit by setting the
  <I>nreject</I>, <I>loreject</I>, and <I>hireject</I> parameters appropriately.
  <P>
  The final bscale and bzero for the input image are computed by calculating
  the average weighted by their errors  of the individual bscale and bzero
  values. The parameters <I>nreject</I>, <I>loreject</I>, and <I>hirject</I>
  can be used to automatically detect and reject deviant points.
  <P>
  The fit algorithm depends on the results of pixel to pixel fits in 
  each reference and input image region. The technique requires that the
  images be spatially registered and psfmatched before it is employed.
  Each input and reference image should contain a range of pixel intensities
  so that both bscale and bzero can be accurately determined.
  <P>
  PHOTOMETRY
  <P>
  For each object common to the reference and input photometry files
  the input sky values sky, errors in the sky values serr,
  magnitudes mag, and magnitude errors merr are used to compute the 
  bscale and bzero factors and estimate their errors as shown
  below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	 bscale = 10.0 ** ((mag[ref] - mag[input]) / 2.5)
  	  bzero = sky[ref] - bscale * sky[input]
      err[bscale] = 0.4 * log(10.0) * bscale * sqrt (merr[ref] ** 2 +
  		  magerr[input] ** 2)) 
       err[bzero] = sqrt (serr[ref] ** 2 + err[bscale] ** 2 *
                    sky[input] ** 2 + bscale ** 2 * sky[input] ** 2)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The final bscale and bzero for the input image are computed by calculation
  the average of the individual bscale and bzero values weighted by their
  errors. The parameters <I>nreject</I>, <I>loreject</I>, and <I>hirject</I> can
  be used to automatically detect and reject deviant points.
  <P>
  THE LEAST SQUARES FITTING TECHNIQUE
  <P>
  The least squares fitting code performs a double linear regression on
  the x and y points,  taking into account the errors in both x and y.
  <P>
  The best fitting line is the defined below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  		y = a * x + b
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The error ellipses  are 
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	S = (x - xfit) ** 2 / err[x] ** 2 + (y - yfit) ** 2 /
  	    err[y] ** 2   
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where S is the quantity to be minimized. Initial values of a and b are
  estimated by  fitting the data to a straight line assuming uniform
  weighting.  The best fit values of a and b are then
  determined by iterating on the relationship
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	dy = x' * da + db
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where da and db are corrections to the previously determined values of a and
  b and dy and x' are defined as.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	dy = y - (ax + b)
  	x' = x + a * err[x] ** 2 * dy / (a ** 2 * err[x] ** 2 +

  The new values of the a and b then become.

  1. Match the intensity scales of a list of images to a reference
  image using a list of stars on the displayed reference image with
  the image cursor and the "<TT>mean</TT>" scaling algorithm. Assume that none
  of the stars are saturated and that a radius of 31 pixels is sufficient
  to include all the flux from the stars plus some background flux.
  Make sure that the correct gain and readout noise values are in the
  image headers.

  registered and psfmatched to the reference image using the "<TT>fit</TT>" algorithm
  and a single reference image region. Remove the effects of saturated
  pixels by setting datamax to 28000 counts, and the effects of any deviant pixels
  by setting nreject, loreject, and hireject to appropriate values.

  6. Match the intensity scales of two images using photometry 
  computed with the apphot package qphot task. The two images are
