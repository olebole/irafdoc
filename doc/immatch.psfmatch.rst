  PSFMATCH computes the convolution kernel required to match the
  point-spread functions
  of the input images <I>input</I> to the point-spread functions of
  the reference images <I>reference</I> using either the image data 
  or pre-computed psfs and the convolution theorem.
  The computed psf matching functions are stored in the <I>kernel</I> images.
  If a non-NULL list of output images <I>output</I> is
  specified the input images are
  convolved with the kernel images to produce a list of psf matched output
  images. PSFMATCH requires
  that the input and reference images be spatially registered
  and that the reference images have poorer resolution (broader PSF)
  than the input images in at least one dimension.
  <P>
  If <I>convolution</I> = "<TT>image</TT>", the matching function is computed directly
  from the input and reference image data using the objects listed in
  <I>psfdata</I> and the convolution theorem as described in the ALGORITHMS
  section. <I>psfdata</I> is interpreted as either: 1) a
  string defining the coordinates of a single object e.g. "<TT>103.3 189.2</TT>" or 2)
  the name of a text file containing the coordinates of one or 
  more objects, one object per line, with the x and y coordinates
  in columns 1 and 2 respectively.  The object coordinates, the
  size of the data region to be extracted <I>dnx</I>
  by <I>dny</I>, and the size of the kernel to be computed <I>pnx</I> and
  <I>pny</I>, determine 
  the input and reference image regions used to compute the psf matching
  function.
  These image regions should be selected with care. Ideal regions 
  contain a single high signal-to-noise unsaturated star which has no close
  neighbors and is well centered on a pixel.
  <P>
  If <I>center</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" and <I>convolution</I> is "<TT>image</TT>", the objects
  in <I>psfdata</I> are centered before
  the data region is extracted.  Centering should be on if the objects
  are stellar, particularly if their coordinates were read from the image
  display cursor. Centering should be off if the objects are non-stellar and
  do not have well-defined centers.
  <P>
  If the <I>background</I> fitting algorithm is other than "<TT>none</TT>" and
  <I>convolution</I> is "<TT>image</TT>", the background for each object is fit using 
  data inside the region defined by
  <I>dnx</I> and <I>dny</I> but outside the region defined by
  <I>pnx</I> by <I>pny</I>. Bad data can be removed from the
  background fit by setting the parameters <I>loreject</I> and <I>hireject</I>.
  A cosine bell function is applied to the edges of the data region
  after background fitting but before computing the psf matching function
  if the <I>apodize</I> parameter is &gt; 0.0.
  <P>
  If <I>psfdata</I> contains more than one object, the extracted image data
  is weighted by the total intensity in the extracted region after
  background subtraction, and averaged to produce a single smoothed
  data region for each reference and input image.
  <P>
  If <I>convolution</I> = "<TT>psf</TT>",
  the psf matching function is computed directly from the input image
  and reference
  image point-spread functions
  using the convolution theorem as described in the ALGORITHMS section.
  In this case  <I>psfdata</I> is the list of input image psfs  and
  <I>reference</I> are the corresponding reference image psfs written by
  by some external psf modeling task. 
  If <I>convolution</I> is "<TT>psf</TT>",
  centering and background fitting
  are assumed to have been performed by the psf modeling task and are not
  performed by PSFMATCH.
  <P>
  PSFMATCH requires that the total power in the psf matching function
  before normalization be the ratio
  of the integrated flux of the reference image/psf over the integrated
  flux of the input image/psf. If <I>fluxratio</I> is INDEF, PSFMATCH
  estimates this number internally as described in the ALGORITHMS section,
  otherwise the <I>fluxratio</I> is set to the value supplied by the user.
  <P>
  If <I>convolution</I> is "<TT>kernel</TT>", PSFMATCH reads the psf matching function
  from the images in <I>kernel</I>  which were either
  created during a previous run of PSFMATCH or by a separate task.
  <P>
  PSFMATCH provides several options for filtering out the ill-behaved
  noise-dominated high frequency components of the psf matching function
  that are produced when the ratio of reference / input image of psf
  fourier transforms is taken.
  <P>
  If <I>filter</I> is set to "<TT>cosbell</TT>", a cosine bell function
  with a taper defined by <I>sx1</I>, <I>sx2</I>, <I>sy1</I>, and <I>sy2</I> and
  symmetry defined by radsym is applied to
  the psf matching function in frequency space. This filter
  sets all the frequency components greater than <I>sx2</I> and <I>sy2</I>
  to 0.0 and leaves all frequency components inside <I>sx1</I> and <I>sy1</I>
  unaltered. Users should exercise this option with caution as the effect
  of the filtering process can be to significantly
  broaden the computed psf matching function as described in the ALGORITHMS
  section.
  <P>
  An alternative approach to dealing with the noisy
  high frequency components of the psf
  matching function it is to replace them with a reasonable guess. If the
  matching function is approximately gaussian then its fourier transform is also
  approximately gaussian and the low frequency components can be modeled
  reliably with an elliptical gaussian function. The model derived from the low
  frequency components of the matching can then be used to replace the high
  frequency components.
  If <I>filter</I> is set to "<TT>replace</TT>", those high frequency components
  of the matching function  which have less than a fraction
  <I>threshold</I> of their total power in the equivalent high frequency
  components of the divisor or input image transform,
  are replaced by a model computed by fitting a gaussian to the low frequency
  components of the matching function, as described in the ALGORITHMS section.
  If <I>filter</I> = "<TT>model</TT>" then the entire psf matching function
  is replaced with the best fitting gaussian model.
  <P>
  Another problem can arise during the computation of the psf matching
  function . Occasionally it is not possible by means of a single execution
  of PSFMATCH to match the reference and input image psfs. An example
  of this situation
  is the case where the seeing of the reference and input images
  was comparable but the declination guiding error in the reference
  image was larger than the error in the input image.
  In this case input image  needs to be convolved to the resolution of 
  the reference image. However it is also the case
  that the guiding error in ra in the input image is greater than the guiding
  error  in ra in the reference image. In this case the reference image needs
  to be convolved to the resolution of the input image along the other axis.
  If no corrective action is taken by the task, the 
  first time PSFMATCH is run the values of the psf matching function along
  the ra axis will be greater than the computed fluxratio, resulting in
  unrealistic action
  along this axis. PSFMATCH avoids this situation by internally limiting
  the psf matching function to a maximum value of fluxratio computed as described
  above. 
  <P>
  By default the psf matching function is normalized to unit power before 
  output. This may not be what is desired since if carefully computed the
  internally computed quantity a contains information about differences
  in exposure time, transparency, etc. If <I>normfactor</I> is set to
  a number of INDEF, the total power of the psf matching function will be
  set to that value of <I>fluxratio</I> respectively.
  <P>
  If a list of output images names has been supplied then the computed
  psf matching function is applied to the input images to produce
  the output images using the boundary extension algorithm
  defined by <I>boundary</I> and <I>constant</I>.
  <P>
  In non-interactive mode the parameters are set at task startup time and
  the input images are processed sequentially. If the <I>verbose</I> flag
  is set messages about the progress of the task are printed on he 
  screen as the task is running.
  <P>
  In interactive mode the user can mark the regions to be used to compute
  the psf matching function on the image display, show/set the data
  and algorithm parameters, compute, recompute, and plot the psf matching
  function and its accompanying fourier spectrum, and experiment with the
  various filtering and modeling options.

  The problem of computing the psf matching function can expressed
  via the convolution theorem as shown below.
  In the following expressions r is the reference
  image data or reference image psf, i is the input image data or input image
  psf, k is the unit power psf matching
  function,
  a is a scale factor specifying the ratio of the total
  power in the reference data or psf to the total power in the input data or
  psf, * is the convolution operator, and FT is the fourier transform operator.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	r = ak * d
  	R = FT (r)
  	I = FT (i)
  	aK = R / I
  	ak = FT (aK)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The quantity ak is the desired psf matching function and aK is its fourier
  transform.
  <P>
  If the background was accurately removed from the image or psf data before the
  psf matching function was computed, the quantity a is simply the central
  frequency component of the computed psf matching function aK as shown below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	aK[0,0] = a = sum(r) / sum(i)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  If the background was not removed from the image or psf data before the
  psf matching function was computed the previous expression is not valid.
  The computed aK[0,0] will include an offset and a must be estimated
  in some other manner. The approach taken by PSFMATCH in this circumstance
  is to fit a gaussian model to the absolute value of 1st and 2nd frequencies
  of R and I along the x and y axes independently, average the fitted x and y
  amplitudes, and set aK[0,0] to the ratio of the resulting fitted amplitudes
  as shown below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	      a = amplitude (R) / amplitude (I)
  	        = (sum(r) - sum(skyr)) / (sum(i) - sum(skyi))  
  	      aK[0,0] = a
  </PRE>
  <P>
  This approach will work well as long as the image data or psf is reasonably
  gaussian but may not work well in arbitrary image regions. If the user is
  dissatisfied with either of the techniques described above they can
  set aK[0,0] to a pre-determined value of their own.
  <P>
  If a filter is applied to the computed psf matching function in frequency
  space then instead of computing
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	       ak = FT (aK)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  PSFMATCH actually computes
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	       ak' = FT (aKF) = ak * f
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where F is the applied filter in frequency space and f is its
  fourier transform. Care should be taken in applying any filter.
  For example if F is the step function, then ak' will be the desired kernel
  ak convolved with f, a sinc function of frequency 2 * PI / hwidth where
  hwidth is the half-width of the step function, and the resulting k'
  will be too broad.
  <P>
  If the user chooses to replace the high frequency components of the psf
  matching function with a best guess, PSFMATCH performs the following
  steps:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  1) fits an elliptical gaussian to those frequency components of the fourier
  spectrum of aK for which for which the amplitude of I is greater
  than threshold * I[0,0] to determine the geometry of the ellipse
  <P>
  2) uses the fourier shift theorem to preserve the phase information in the
  model and solve for any x and y shifts
  <P>
  3) replace those frequency components of aK for which the fourier spectrum
  of I is less than threshold * I[0,0] with the model values
  <P>
  		or alternatively
  <P>
  replace all of aK with the model values

  1. Psf match a list of input images taken at different epochs with variable
  seeing conditions to a reference image with the poorest seeing by marking
  several high signal-to-noise isolated stars on the displayed reference image
  and computing the psf matching function directly from the input and reference
  image data. User makes two runs with psfmatch one to compute and check the
  kernel images and one to match the images.

  2. Psf match two spectra using a high signal-to-noise portion of the
  data in the middle of the spectrum. Since the spectra are registered
  spatially and there is little data available for background fitting the
  user chooses to turn centering off and set the backgrounds manually.

  3. Psf match two images using psf functions inpsf and refpsf computed with
  the daophot package phot/psf/seepsf tasks. Since the kernel is fairly
  large use the stsdas fourier package task fconvolve to do the actual
  convolution. The boundary extension algorithm in fconvolve is equivalent
  to setting the psfmatch boundary extension parameters boundary and
  constant to "<TT>constant</TT>" and "<TT>0.0</TT>" respectively.
