  XREGISTER computes the x and y shifts required to register a list of input
  images <I>input</I> to a list of reference images <I>reference</I> using
  cross-correlation techniques. The computed x and y shifts are stored
  in the text file <I>shifts</I>, in the records <I>records</I> if
  <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" or a single line of a simple text file
  if <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>no</TT>". One entry is made in the shifts file for
  each input image. If a non NULL list of output images
  <I>output</I> is supplied a shifted output image is written for each input
  image. XREGISTER is intended to solve 1D and 2D image registration problems
  where the images have the same size, the same pixel scale, are shifted
  relative to
  each other by simple translations in x and y, and contain one or more
  extended features in common that will produce a peak in the computed
  cross-correlation function.
  <P>
  The reference image regions used to compute the cross-correlation
  function shifts are defined by the parameter
  <I>regions</I>. <I>Regions</I> may be:
  1) a list of one or more image sections, e.g.
  "<TT>[100:200,100:200] [400:500,400:500]</TT>" separated
  by whitespace, 2) the name of a text file containing a list of one or
  more image sections separated by whitespace and / or newline characters,
  or, 3) a string
  of the form "<TT>grid nx ny</TT>" specifying a grid of nx by ny
  image sections spanning the entire reference image.
  All reference image regions should be chosen so as to 
  include at least one well-defined object or feature. Cross-correlation
  functions and x and y shifts are computed independently for each
  reference image region
  and averaged to produce the final x and y shift for each input image.
  <P>
  By default the initial x and y lags between the input and reference
  image are assumed to by 0.0 and 0.0
  respectively and each reference image region is cross-correlated
  with the identical region in the input image, e.g reference image
  region [100:200,100:200] is cross-correlated with input image
  region [100:200,100:200].
  <P>
  Non-zero initial guesses for
  the x and y shifts for each input image can be input to XREGISTER using
  the coordinates file parameter <I>coords</I>.
  <I>Coords</I> is a simple text file containing the x
  and y coordinates of a  single
  object in the reference image in columns one and two
  of line one, and the x and y coordinates of the same object in the first
  input image in columns one and two of line two, etc. If <I>coords</I>
  is defined there must be one coordinate file for every reference image.
  If there are fewer lines of text in <I>coords</I> than there are 
  numbers of reference plus input images, then x and y shifts of 0.0 are
  assumed for the extra input images. For example,
  if the  user specifies a single input and reference image, sets the
  <I>regions</I> parameter to "<TT>[100:200,100:200]</TT>", and defines
  a coordinates file  which contains the numbers 
  50.0 50.0 in columns one and two of line one,  and the numbers 52.0 and 52.0
  in columns one and two of line two, then the initial x and y
  lags for the input image with respect to the reference image will be 2.0
  and 2.0 respectively, and the reference image region [100:200,100:200] will be
  cross-correlated with the input image region [102:202,102:202]. 
  <P>
  If <I>coords</I> is NULL, the parameters <I>xlag</I>, <I>ylag</I>,
  <I>dxlag</I>, and <I>dylag</I> can be used to define initial x and y lags
  for each input image. <I>Xlag</I> and <I>ylag</I> define the x and y lags
  of the first input image with respect to the reference image. In the
  example above they would be set to 2.0 and 2.0 respectively. Initial
  shifts for succeeding images are computed by adding the values of the
  <I>dxlag</I> and <I>dylag</I> parameters  to the values of
  <I>xlag</I> and <I>ylag</I> assumed for the previous image.
  If <I>dxlag</I> and <I>dylag</I> are 0.0 and 0.0
  the same initial x and y lag will be used for all the input
  images. If <I>dxlag</I> and <I>dylag</I> are both finite numbers then these
  numbers will be added to
  the x and y lags assumed for the previous image. If these numbers
  are both INDEF then the computed x and y lags for the previous image
  will be used to compute the initial x and y lags for the current image.
  Both options can be useful for time series images where the x and y
  shifts between successive images display some regular behavior.
  <P>
  Prior to computing the cross-correlation function
  large mean background values and gradients should be removed
  from the input and reference image data as either
  can seriously degrade the peak of the cross-correlation
  function.  To first order XREGISTER computes the cross-correlation function
  in a manner which removes
  the effect of large mean background values from the resulting
  function. For many if not most typical data sets the user can safely leave
  the parameter <I>background</I> at its default value of "<TT>none</TT>" and
  achieve reasonable results. For more demanding data sets the user should
  experiment with the "<TT>mean</TT>", "<TT>median</TT>", and "<TT>plane</TT>" background fitting
  algorithms which compute and subtract, the mean value, median value, and
  a plane from the input and reference image data respectively,
  before computing the
  cross-correlation function. The region used to compute the background fitting
  function can be restricted to a border around the reference and
  input image regions by setting the <I>border</I> parameter. Bad
  data can be rejected from the background fit by setting the <I>loreject</I>
  and <I>hireject</I> parameters.
  <P>
  A cosine bell function can be applied to the edges of the input and
  reference image data before
  computing the cross-correlation function by setting the <I>apodize</I>
  parameter.
  <P>
  If the <I>filter</I> parameter is set to "<TT>laplace</TT>" instead of its default
  value of "<TT>none</TT>" then a Laplacian filter is applied to the input and
  reference image data before the cross-correlation function is computed.
  This spatial filtering operation effectively
  removes both a background and a slope from the input and reference image
  data and
  highlights regions of the image where the intensity is changing rapidly.
  The effectiveness of this filtering operation in sharpening the
  correlation peak depends on the degree to
  which the intensity in adjacent pixels is correlated.
  <P>
  The cross-correlation function for each region is computed by
  discrete convolution, <I>correlation</I> = "<TT>discrete</TT>",
  Fourier convolution, <I>correlation</I> = "<TT>fourier</TT>", or by computing
  the error function, <I>correlation</I> = "<TT>difference</TT>". The x and y lag
  space in pixels around the initial x and y lag over which the cross-correlation 
  function is searched for the correlation peak, is specified by the
  <I>xwindow</I> and
  <I>ywindow</I>  parameters. These parameter define a range of x and y lags from
  -xwindow / 2 to xwindow / 2 and -ywindow / 2 to ywindow / 2 respectively. For
  a given input and reference image region, the
  execution time of XREGISTER will depend strongly on both the correlation
  algorithm chosen and
  the size of the search window. In general users should use discrete
  or difference correlation for small search windows and fourier
  correlation for large search windows.
  <P>
  The x and y lags for each input and reference image
  region are computed by computing
  the position of the peak of the cross-correlation function in the
  search window using
  one of the four centering algorithms: "<TT>none</TT>", "<TT>centroid</TT>", "<TT>sawtooth</TT>",
  and "<TT>parabolic</TT>".
  <P>
  The computed x and y shifts for each region and the final x and y shift
  for each input image (where the computed x and y shifts are just the negative
  of the computed x and y lags) are written to the shifts file <I>shifts</I>.
  If <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" each results is written in a record whose name
  is either identical to the name of the input
  image or supplied by the user via the <I>records</I> parameter .
  If <I>databasefmt</I> is "<TT>no</TT>", then a single containing the input image
  name and the computed x and y shifts is written to the output shifts file.
  <P>
  If a list of output image names have been supplied then the x and y
  shifts will be applied to the input images to compute the output images
  using the interpolant type specified by <I>interp_type</I> and the
  boundary extension algorithm specified by <I>boundary</I> and <I>constant</I>. 
  <P>
  If the <I>correlation</I> parameter is set to "<TT>file</TT>" then the shifts
  computed in a previous run of XREGISTER will be read from the <I>shifts</I>
  file and applied to the input images to compute the output images.
  If no record list is supplied by the user XREGISTER will for each input
  image search for
  a record whose name is the same as the input image name. If more than
  one record of the same name is found then the most recently written
  record will be used.
  <P>
  XREGISTER does not currently trim the input images but it computes and
  prints the region over which they all overlap in the form of an image
  section. Although XREGISTER is designed for use with same sized images,
  it may be used with images of varying size.
  In this case it is possible for the calculated overlap region to be vignetted,
  as XREGISTER currently preserves the size of the input image when it shifts it.
  For example if an image is much smaller than the reference image
  it is possible for the image to be shifted outside of its own borders.
  If the smallest image is used as a reference this will not occur. If
  vignetting is detected the vignetted image section is printed on the 
  screen. Vignetting may also occur for a list of same-sized images
  if the reference image is not included in the input image list, and the
  computed shifts are all positive or negative as may occur in a time
  sequence. Choosing a reference image with  a shift which is in the
  middle of the observed range of shifts in x and y will remove this problem.
  <P>
  In non-interactive mode the parameters are set at task startup
  and the input images are processed sequentially. If the <I>verbose</I>
  flag is set messages about the progress of the task are printed on the
  screen as the task is running.
  <P>
  In interactive mode the user can mark the regions to be used
  to compute the cross-correlation function on the image display,
  define the initial shifts from the reference image to the input image
  on the image display, show/set the data and algorithm parameters,
  compute, recompute,  and plot the cross-correlation function, experiment
  with the various peak fitting algorithms, and overlay row and column
  plots of the input and reference images with and without the initial and / or
  computed shifts factored in.
