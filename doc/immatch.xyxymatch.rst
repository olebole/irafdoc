  <DD>A linear transformation is applied to the input coordinate list,
  the transformed input list and the reference list are sorted, 
  points which are too close together are removed, and the input coordinates
  which most closely match the reference coordinates within the
  user specified tolerance are determined.  The tolerance algorithm requires
  an initial estimate for the linear transformation.  This estimate can be
  derived interactively by pointing to common objects in the two displayed
  images, by supplying the coordinates of tie points via the
  <I>refpoints</I> file, or by setting the linear transformation parameters
  <I>xin</I>, <I>yin</I>, <I>xmag</I>, <I>ymag</I>, <I>xrotation</I>,
  <I>yrotation</I>, <I>xref</I>, and <I>yref</I>. Assuming that
  well chosen tie points are supplied, the tolerance algorithm 
  functions well in the presence of any shifts, axis flips, x and y
  scale changes, rotations, and axis skew, between the two coordinate
  systems. The algorithm is sensitive to higher order distortion terms
  in the coordinate transformation.

  <DD>A linear transformation is applied to the input coordinate list,

  matching technique and the user specified tolerance parameter.
  The triangles pattern matching algorithm does not require prior knowledge
  of the linear transformation, although it will use one if one is supplied.
  The algorithm functions well in the presence of
  any shifts, axis flips, magnification, and rotation between the two coordinate
  systems as long as both lists have a reasonable number of objects
  in common and the errors in the computed coordinates are small.
  However since the algorithm depends on comparisons of similar triangles, it
  is sensitive to differences in the x and y coordinate scales,
  any skew between the x and y axes, and higher order distortion terms

  XYXYMATCH matches the x and y coordinates in the reference coordinate list
  <I>reference</I> to the corresponding x and y coordinates in the input
  coordinate list <I>input</I> to within a user specified tolerance
  <I>tolerance</I>, and writes the matched coordinates to the output
  file <I>output</I>.  The output file is suitable for input to the 
  GEOMAP task which computes the actual transformation required to
  register the corresponding reference and input images.
  <P>
  XYXYMATCH matches the coordinate lists by: 1) computing an initial
  guess at the linear transformation required to match the input
  coordinate system to the reference coordinate system, 2) applying
  the computed transformation to the input coordinates, 3) sorting
  the reference and input coordinates and removing points with a
  minimum separation specified by the parameter <I>separation</I>
  from both lists, 4) matching the two lists using either the "<TT>tolerance</TT>"
  or "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm, and 5) writing the matched list to the
  output file.
  <P>
  The initial estimate of the linear transformation is computed in one of 
  three ways.  If <I>interactive</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" the user displays the reference and
  input images corresponding to the reference and input coordinate files
  on the image display, and marks up to three objects which the two
  images have in common with the image cursor. The coordinates of these
  tie points are used as tie points to compute the linear transformation.
  If <I>refpoints</I> is defined, the x-y coordinates of up to three tie
  points are read from succeeding lines in the refpoints file. The format
  of two sample refpoints files is shown below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  # First sample refpoints file (1 reference file and N input files)
  <P>
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for reference coordinate file
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file 1
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file 2
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file N
  <P>
  <P>
  # Second sample refpoints file (N reference files and N input files)
  <P>
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for reference coordinate file 1
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file 1
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for reference coordinate file 2
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file 2
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for reference coordinate file N
  x1 y1  [x2 y2 [x3 y3]]   # tie points for input coordinate file N

  <P>
  The coordinates of the tie points can be typed in by hand if <I>refpoints</I>
  is "<TT>STDIN</TT>". If the refpoints file is undefined the parameters
  <I>xin</I>, <I>xin</I>, <I>xmag</I>, <I>ymag</I>, <I>xrotation</I>, <I>yrotation</I>,
  <I>xref</I>, and <I>yref</I> are used to compute the linear transformation
  from the input coordinates [xi,yi] to the reference coordinates [xr,yr]
  as shown below. Orientation and skew are the orientation of the x and y axes
  and their deviation from non-perpendicularity respectively.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	xr = a + b * xi + c * yi
  	yr = d + e * xi + f * yi
      
  	xrotation = orientation - skew / 2
  	yrotation = orientation + skew / 2
  	b = xmag * cos (xrotation)
  	c = -ymag * sin (yrotation)
  	e = xmag * sin (xrotation)
  	f = ymag * cos (yrotation)
  	a = xref - b * xin - c * yin = xshift
  	d = yref - e * xin - f * yin = yshift
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The reference and input coordinates are read from columns <I>xrcolumn</I>,
  <I>yrcolumn</I> in the reference, and <I>xcolumn</I>, and <I>ycolumn</I> in the
  input coordinate lists respectively. The input coordinates are transformed
  using the computed linear transformation and stars closer together than
  <I>separation</I> pixels are removed from both lists.
  <P>
  The coordinate lists are matched using the algorithm specified by
  the <I>matching</I>
  parameter. If matching is "<TT>tolerance</TT>", XYXYMATCH searches the sorted
  transformed input coordinate list for the object closest to the current
  reference object within the matching tolerance <I>tolerance</I>.
  The major advantage of the "<TT>tolerance</TT>" algorithm is that it can deal
  with x and y scale differences and axis skew in the coordinate
  transformation. The major disadvantage is that the user must supply
  tie point information in all but the simplest case of small x and y
  shifts between the input and reference coordinate systems.
  <P>
  If matching is "<TT>triangles</TT>" XYXYMATCH constructs a list of triangles
  using up to <I>nmatch</I> reference coordinates and transformed input
  coordinates, and performs a pattern matching operation on the resulting
  triangle lists. If the number of coordinates
  in both lists is less than <I>nmatch</I> the entire list is matched using
  the "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm directly, otherwise the "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm
  is used to estimate a new linear transformation, the input coordinate
  list is transformed using the new transformation, and the entire list
  is matched using the "<TT>tolerance</TT>" algorithm. The major advantage of the
  "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm is that it requires no tie point information
  from the user. The major disadvantages are that it is sensitive to
  x and y scale differences and axis skews between the input and reference
  coordinate systems and can be computationally expensive.
  <P>
  The matched x and y reference and input coordinate lists are written to
  columns 1 and 2, and 3 and 4 of the output file respectively, in a format
  specified by the <I>xformat</I> and <I>yformat</I> parameters.
  The respective line numbers in the original reference and input
  coordinate files are written to columns 5 and 6 respectively.
  <P>
  If <I>verbose</I> is yes, detailed messages about actions taken by the
  task are written to the terminal as the task executes.

  <P>
  The "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm uses a sophisticated pattern matching
  technique which requires no tie point information from the user.
  It is expensive computationally and hence is restricted to a maximum
  of <I>nmatch</I> objects from the reference and input coordinate lists.
  <P>
  The "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm first generates a list
  of all the possible triangles that can be formed from the points in each list.
  For a list of nmatch points this number is the combinatorial factor
  nmatch! / [(nmatch-3)! * 3!] or  nmatch * (nmatch-1) * (nmatch-2) / 6.
  The length of the perimeter, ratio of longest to shortest side, cosine
  of the angle between the longest and shortest side, the tolerances in
  the latter two quantities and the direction of the arrangement of the vertices
  of each triangle are computed and stored in a table.
  Triangles with vertices closer together than <I>tolerance</I> or
  with a ratio of the longest to shortest side greater than <I>ratio</I>
  are discarded. The remaining triangles are sorted in order of increasing
  ratio.  A sort merge algorithm is used to match the triangles using the
  ratio and cosine information, the tolerances in these quantities, and
  the maximum tolerances for both lists. Next the ratios of the
  perimeters of the matched triangles are compared to the average ratio
  for the entire list, and triangles which deviate too widely from the mean
  are discarded. The number of triangles remaining are divided into
  the number which match in the clockwise sense and the number which match
  in the counter-clockwise sense. Those in the minority category
  are eliminated.
  The rejection step can be repeated up to <I>nreject</I> times or until
  no more rejections occur whichever comes first.
  The last step in the algorithm is a voting procedure in which each remaining
  matched triangle casts three votes, one for each matched pair of vertices.
  Points which have fewer than half the maximum number of
  votes are discarded. The final set of matches are written to the output file.
  <P>
  The "<TT>triangles</TT>" algorithm functions well when the reference and
  input coordinate lists have a sufficient number of objects (~50%, 
  in some cases as low as 25%) of their objects in common, any distortions
  including x and y scale differences and skew between the two systems are small,
  and the random errors in the coordinates are small. Increasing the value of the
  <I>tolerance</I> parameter will increase the ability to deal with distortions but
  will also produce more false matches.
