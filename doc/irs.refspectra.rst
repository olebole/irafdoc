  This task allows the user to define which reference spectra are to be 
  used in the calculation of the dispersion solution of object spectra.
  The assignment of reference spectra to object spectra is often
  a complex task because of the number of spectra, the use of many distinct
  apertures, and different modes of observing such as interspersed arc
  calibration spectra or just one calibration for a night.  This task
  provides a number of methods to cover many of the common cases.
  <P>
  A reference spectrum is defined to be a spectrum that has been used to
  calculate a wavelength solution with the tasks IDENTIFY or REIDENTIFY.
  These tasks have set the keyword REFSPEC1 in the image header
  equal to the spectrum's own name.
  <P>
  Wavelength reference spectra are assigned to input spectra by entering
  the reference spectrum name or pair of names in the image
  header under the keywords REFSPEC1 and REFSPEC2.  When two reference
  spectra are assigned, the spectrum names may be followed by a weighting
  factor (assumed to be 1 if missing).  The wavelength of a pixel is
  then the weighted average of the wavelengths from the reference
  spectra dispersion solutions.  The weighting factors are calculated
  by choosing an appropriate selection method, ie average, interpolation,
  etc. Note, however, that these assignments may be made directly using
  the task <B>hedit</B> or with some other task or script if none of the
  methods are suitable. 
  <P>
  The spectra to be assigned references are specified by an input list.
  Optional numeric record format extensions may be appended to each name
  (used as a root name) in the input list in the <B>iids/irs</B> packages.
  The input spectra may be restricted to a particular set of aperture numbers
  by the parameter <I>apertures</I>; the spectra not in the list of apertures
  are skipped.  If the aperture list is null (i.e. specified as "<TT></TT>") then all
  apertures are selected.  One further selection may be made on the input
  spectra.  If the parameter <I>override</I> is no then input spectra which
  have existing reference spectra assignments (which includes the reference
  spectra) are skipped.
  <P>
  The reference spectra parameter <I>references</I> may take two forms.
  It may be an image list of spectra or a text file containing
  a "<TT>reference spectrum assignment table</TT>".  The table consists of pairs
  of strings/lists with the first string being a list of object spectra
  and the second string being a list of reference spectra.  If this
  table is used, then only those object spectra in the table that are also
  listed in the input parameter list are processed.  The example below
  illustrates the reference spectrum assignment table:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	spec1		spec2,spec3,spec4
  	spec5
  	spec6,spec7	spect8,spec9
  	spec10		spec11
  	spec12		spec13
  	spec14		spec15
  </PRE>
  <P>
  As a convenience, if a reference list in the table is missing, the preceding
  reference list is implied. This table may be used to make arbitrary assignments.
  <P>
  The reference spectra in the specified list may also be restricted to a
  subset of aperture numbers.  However, in the case of averaging, the
  reference aperture selection is ignored. In the case of matching, if
  a reference spectrum is not selected then the matching input spectrum
  is also skipped (in order to maintain a one-to-one correspondence).
  Spectra in the reference list which are not reference spectra (as
  defined earlier) are also ignored and a warning is printed.  Note that
  no check is made that a dispersion solution actually exists in the
  dispersion solution database.
  <P>
  There may be cases where there are only reference spectra for some
  apertures and it is desired to apply these reference spectra to the
  other apertures.  The <I>ignoreaps</I> flag may be used to force an
  assignment between reference and object spectra with different
  aperture numbers.  Note that this flag is applied after the input and
  reference list aperture number selections are made; in other words this
  applies only to the assignments and not the input selection process.
  <P>
  Once the appropriate reference spectra from the reference list have been
  determined for an input spectrum they are assigned using one of the
  methods selected by the parameter <I>select</I>.  The "<TT>match</TT>" method
  simply pairs each element of the input spectrum list with each element
  in the reference spectrum list.  If a reference assignment table
  is used with "<TT>match</TT>", then only the first spectrum in the reference
  list for each input spectrum is assigned.
  <P>
  The "<TT>average</TT>" method assigns the first two spectra in the reference list
  ignoring aperture numbers or groups. The spectra are averaged by assigning
  equal weights.  There is no weighting based on any sort parameter.  If
  there are more than two spectra in the reference list then only the first
  two spectra are used and the remainder are ignored.  If a reference
  assignment table is used only the first two reference spectra listed for
  each object in the table are averaged.
  <P>
  The remaining selection methods group the spectra using a header keyword
  which must be constant within a group.  If no group parameter is specfied
  (the null string "<TT></TT>" or the word "<TT>none</TT>")
  then grouping does not occur.  Only reference spectra with the same
  group header value as the object are assigned to an object spectrum.
  One likely group parameter is the "<TT>date-obs</TT>" keyword.  This is usually
  constant over a night at CTIO and KPNO.  At other sites this may not
  be the case.  Therefore, the task <B>setjd</B> may be used to set a
  local Julian day number which is constant over a night at any
  observatory.
  <P>
  Within a group the spectra are ordered based on a numeric image header
  parameter specified by the <I>sort</I> parameter.  A null string "<TT></TT>" or the
  word "<TT>null</TT>" may be used to select no sort parameter.  Parameters which are
  times, as indicated by the <I>time</I> parameter, are assumed to be cyclic
  with a period of 24 hours.  The time wrap parameter defines the origin of a
  cycle and should precede the first observation and follow the last
  observation in a 24 hour period; i.e. for nighttime observations this
  parameter value should bee sometime during the day.  Particularly with
  interpolating or choosing the nearest reference spectrum it is important
  that the sorting parameter refer to the middle of the exposure.  A Julian
  date at the middle of an exposure may be calculated with the task
  <B>setjd</B> or a middle UT time may be computed with the task
  <B>setairmass</B>.
  <P>
  The selection methods may choose the "<TT>nearest</TT>", "<TT>preceding</TT>", or "<TT>following</TT>"
  reference spectrum.  Alternatively, the reference wavelengths may be
  interpolated between the preceding and following reference spectra with
  weights given by the relative distances measured by the sorting parameter.
  In the cases where a preceding or following spectrum is required and one is
  not found then the nearest reference spectrum is used.  These methods are
  used for observing sequences where the reference spectra are taken either
  nearby in time or space.
  <P>
  The option "<TT>interp</TT>" should not be used without some thought as to the
  nature of the interpolation.  If the sorting parameter is a time (a 24 hour
  cyclic parameter as opposed to a continuous parameter such as a Julian
  date) then the user must be aware of when these times were recorded in the
  header.  For example, let us assume that the sort parameter is "<TT>ut</TT>" and
  that this time was recorded in the header at the beginning of the
  exposure.  If the object spectrum exposure time is longer than the
  reference spectra exposure times, then interpolation will weight the
  preceding reference spectrum too heavily.  This problem can be circumvented
  by using the "<TT>average</TT>" selection method along with the reference assignment
  table.  Or the sort time parameter in the headers of the spectra can be
  changes with <I>setjd</I> or <I>setairmass</I> or edited to reflect the
  values at mid-exposure (see EXAMPLES).
  <P>
  Once the reference spectrum or spectra for a input spectrum have been 
  identified the user may also chose to override any previous reference
  assignments, to accept or not accept the current reference assignments
  (in the case of not accepting the reference assignment the image header
  is not updated), to only list the current reference assignments and not
  update any image headers, as well as to record the reference assignments
  to log files.  These options are separately controlled by the remaining
  task parameters.

  7.  Assign reference spectra with weights using interpolation.  In this
  example we want to sort by "<TT>ut</TT>" but this keyword value was 
  recorded at the beginning of the integration. So we first create an
  new keyword and then compute its value to be that of mid-exposure.  The
  new keyword is then used as the sorting parameter.
