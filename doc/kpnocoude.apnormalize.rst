  <UL>
  For each image in the input image list the two dimensional spectra
  defined by a set of apertures are normalized by a one dimensional
  normalization function derived by extracting and smoothing the spectrum
  by fitting a function with the <B>icfit</B> procedure.  The value of the
  fitting function at each point along the dispersion, divided by the
  aperture width to form a mean or scaled to the same mean as the center
  pixel of the aperture depending on the <I>cennorm</I> parameter, is
  divided into the two dimensional input aperture.  All points outside
  the apertures are set to unity.
  <P>
  The purpose of this task is to remove a general shape from the aperture
  spectra.  If low order (order = 1 for instance) functions are used then
  only the amplitudes of the spectra are affected, shifting each aperture
  to approximately unit intensity per pixel.  If high order functions are
  used only the small spatial scale variations are preserved.  This
  is useful for making flat field images with the spectral signature of the
  continuum source removed or for producing two dimensional normalized
  spectra similar to the task <B>onedspec.continuum</B>.  For flat fields
  this algorithm retains the profile shape which may be useful for
  removing the profile response in short slit data.  However, often
  one does not want the profile of the flat fielded observation to be
  modified in which case the task <B>apflatten</B> should be used.
  <P>
  The normalization spectrum is first extracted in the same way as is
  the one dimensional extraction in <B>apsum</B> or <B>apall</B>.  In
  particular the same parameters for selecting weighting and cleaning
  are available.  After extraction the spectrum is fit using the
  <B>icfit</B> routine.  This may be done interactively or noninteractively
  depending on the <I>interactive</I> parameter.  The default fitting
  parameters are part of this task.  The goal of the fitting depends
  on the application.  One may be trying to simply continuum normalize,
  in which case one wants to iteratively reject and grow the rejected
  points to exclude the lines and fit the continuum with a
  moderate order function (see <B>continuum</B> for more discussion).  
  If one wants to simply normalize all spectra to a common flux, say to
  remove a blaze function in echelle data, then an order of 1 will
  normalize by a constant.  For flat field and profile correction of
  small slits one wants to fit the large scale shape of the
  spectrum but not fit the small bumps and wiggles due to sensitivity
  variations and fringing.
  <P>
  The smoothed extracted spectrum represents the total flux within the
  aperture.  There are two choices for scaling to a normalization per
  pixel.  One is to divide by the aperture width, thus computing an average
  flux normalization.  In this case the peak of the spectrum will be
  greater than unity.  This is done when <I>cennorm</I> = no.  When this
  parameter has the value yes then the mean of the normalization spectrum
  is scaled to the mean of the aperture center, computed by linearly
  interpolating the two pixels about the traced center.  This will give
  values near one for the pixels at the center of the aperture in the
  final output image.
  <P>
  Before division of each pixel by the appropriate dispersion point in
  the normalization spectrum, all pixels below the value specified by the
  <I>threshold</I> parameter in the normalization spectrum are replaced by
  the threshold value.  This suppresses division by very small numbers.
  Finally, the pixels within the aperture are divided by the normalization
  function and the pixels outside the apertures are set to 1.
  <P>
  The remainder of this description covers the basic steps defining the
  apertures to be used.  These steps and parameter are much the same as
  in any of the other <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  Aperture definitions may be inherited from those of other images by
  specifying a reference image with the <B>references</B> parameter.
  Images in the reference list are matched with those in the input list
  in order.  If the reference image list is shorter than the number of
  input images, the last reference image is used for all remaining input
  images.  Thus, a single reference image may be given for all the input
  images or different reference images may be given for each input
  image.  The special reference name "<TT>last</TT>" may be used to select the
  last set apertures used in any of the <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  If an aperture reference image is not specified or no apertures are
  found for the specified reference image, previously defined apertures
  for the input image are sought in the aperture database.  Note that
  reference apertures supersede apertures for the input image.  If no
  apertures are defined they may be created automatically, the <I>find</I>
  option, or interactively in the aperture editor, if the
  <I>interactive</I> and <I>edit</I> options are set.
  <P>
  The functions performed by the task are selected by a set of flag
  parameters.  The functions are an automatic spectrum finding and
  aperture defining algorithm (see <B>apfind</B>) which is ignored if
  apertures are already defined, automatic recentering and resizing
  algorithms (see <B>aprecenter</B> and <B>apresize</B>), an interactive
  aperture editing function (see <B>apedit</B>), a spectrum position tracing
  and trace function fit (see <B>aptrace</B>), and the main function of
  this task, the one dimensional normalization of the aperture
  profiles.
  <P>
  Each function selection will produce a query for each input spectrum if
  the <I>interactive</I> parameter is set.  The queries are answered by
  "<TT>yes</TT>", "<TT>no</TT>", "<TT>YES</TT>", or "<TT>NO</TT>", where the upper case responses suppress
  the query for following images.  There are other queries associated
  with tracing which first ask whether the operation is to be done
  interactively and, if yes, lead to queries for each aperture.  If the
  <I>interactive</I> parameter is not set then aperture editing,
  interactive trace fitting, and interactive spectrum shape fitting are ignored.
