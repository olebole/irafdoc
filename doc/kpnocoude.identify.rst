  <UL>
  Features are interactively marked in one dimensional image vectors.
  The features may be spectral lines when the vector is a spectrum
  or profile positions when the vector is a spatial cut.  A function
  may be fit to the user coordinates as a function of pixel coordinates.
  This is primarily used to find dispersion functions for spectra
  such as arc-line calibration spectra.  The profile position measurements
  are generally used for geometric calibrations.

  Features in the input images are identified interactively and assigned
  user coordinates.  A "<TT>coordinate function</TT>" mapping pixel coordinates to
  user coordinates may be determined from the identified features.  A
  user coordinate list may be defined to automatically identify additional
  features.  This task is used to measure positions of features,
  determine dispersion solutions for spectra, and to identify features in
  two and three dimensional images for mapping a two or three dimensional
  coordinate transformation.  Because of this dual use the terms vector
  and feature are used rather than spectrum and spectral line.
  <P>
  Each image in the input list is considered in turn.  If the image is
  not one dimensional or a one dimensional section of an image
  then the image section given by the parameter
  <I>section</I> is used.  This parameter may be specified in several ways as
  described in the PARAMETERS and EXAMPLES sections.  The image section is used
  to select a starting vector and image axis.
  <P>
  If the image is not one dimensional or in multispec format then the number
  of lines, columns, or bands given by the parameter <I>nsum</I> are summed.
  The one dimensional image vector is graphed.  The initial feature list and
  coordinate function are read from the database if an entry exists.  The
  features are marked on the graph.  The image coordinates are in pixels
  unless a coordinate function is defined, in which case they are in user
  coordinate units.  The pixel coordinate, coordinate function value, and
  user coordinate for the current feature are printed.
  <P>
  The graphics cursor is used to select features and perform various
  functions.  A menu of the keystroke options and functions is printed
  with the key <TT>'?'</TT>.  The cursor keys and their functions are defined in
  the CURSOR KEYS section and described further below.  The standard
  cursor mode keys are also available to window and redraw the graph and
  to produce hardcopy "<TT>snaps</TT>".
  <P>
  There are a number of ways of defining features.  They fall into
  two categories; interactively defining features with the cursor
  and using automatic algorithms.
  <P>
  The <TT>'m'</TT> key is the principle interactive feature marking method.  Typing
  <TT>'m'</TT> near the position of a feature applies a feature centering algorithm
  (see <B>center1d</B>) and, if a center is found, the feature is entered in
  the feature list and marked on the spectrum.  If the new position is within
  a distance given by the parameter <I>minsep</I> of a previous feature it is
  considered to be the same feature and replaces the old feature.  Normally
  the position of a new feature will be exactly the same as the original
  feature.  The coordinate list is searched for a match between the
  coordinate function value (when defined) and a user coordinate in the
  list.  If a match is found it becomes the default user coordinate which the
  user may override.  The new feature is marked on the graph and it becomes
  the current feature.  The redefinition of a feature which is within the
  minimum separation may be used to set the user coordinate from the
  coordinate list.  The <TT>'t'</TT> key allows setting the position of a feature to
  other than that found by the centering algorithm.
  <P>
  The principle automatic feature identification algorithm is executed
  with the <TT>'b'</TT> key.  The user is queried for an approximate coordinate
  value and coordinate interval per pixel.  The coordinate value
  is for the center of the spectrum by default though this may be changed
  with the <B>aidpars</B> parameters.  Only the magnitude of the
  coordinate interval per pixel is used by default though this also
  may be changed.  Either value may be given as INDEF to do an unconstrained
  search, however, this will be much slower and more likely to fail.
  The algorithm searches for matches between the strong lines in the
  spectrum and lines in the coordinate list.  The algorithm is described
  in the documentation for <B>aidpars</B>.
  <P>
  The <TT>'b'</TT> key works with no predefined dispersion solution or features.  If
  two or more features are identified, with <TT>'m'</TT>, spanning the range of the
  data or if a coordinate function is defined, from a previous solution, then
  the <TT>'e'</TT>, <TT>'l'</TT>, and <TT>'y'</TT> keys may be used to identify additional features from
  a coordinate list.  The <TT>'e'</TT> key only adds features at the coordinates of
  the line lists if the centering algorithm finds a feature at that
  wavelength (as described below).  The <TT>'y'</TT> key works in reverse by finding
  the prominent features using a peak finding algorithm and then looking in
  the coordinate list for entries near the estimated position.  Up to a
  maximum number of features (<I>maxfeatures</I>) will be selected.  If there
  are more peaks only the strongest are kept.  In either of these cases there
  is no automatic fitting and refitting of the dispersion function.
  <P>
  The <TT>'l'</TT> key combines automatic fits with locating lines from the coordinate
  list.  If two or more features are defined an initial fit is made.  Then
  for each coordinate value in the coordinate list the pixel coordinate is
  determined and a search for a feature at that point is made.  If a feature
  is found (based on the parameters <I>ftype, fwidth</I>, <I>cradius</I>, and
  <B>threshold</B>) its user coordinate value based on the coordinate function
  is determined.  If the coordinate function value matches the user
  coordinate from the coordinate list within the error limit set by the
  parameter <I>match</I> then the new feature is entered in the feature list.
  Up to a maximum number of features, set by the parameter <I>maxfeatures</I>,
  may be defined in this way.  A new user coordinate function is fit to all
  the located features.  Finally, the graph is redrawn in user coordinates
  with the additional features found from the coordinate list marked.
  <P>
  A minimum of two features must be defined for the <TT>'l'</TT> key algorithm to
  work.  However, three or more features are preferable to determine changes
  in the dispersion as a function of position.
  <P>
  The <TT>'f'</TT> key fits a function of the pixel coordinates to the user
  coordinates.  The type of function, order and other fitting parameters
  are initially set with the parameters <I>function, order, sample,
  niterate, low_reject, high_reject</I> and <I>grow</I>..  The value of the
  function for a particular pixel coordinate is called the function
  coordinate and each feature in the feature list has a function
  coordinate value.  The fitted function also is used to convert pixel
  coordinates to user coordinates in the graph.  The fitting is done
  within the interactive curve fitting package which has its own set of
  interactive commands.  For further information on this package see the
  help material under <B>icfit</B>.
  <P>
  If a zero point shift is desired without changing the coordinate function
  the user may specify the coordinate of a point in the spectrum with
  the <TT>'s'</TT> key from which a shift is determined.  The <TT>'g'</TT> key also
  determines a shift by minimizing the difference between the user
  coordinates and the fitted coordinates.  This is used when a previously
  determined coordinate function is applied to a new spectrum having
  fewer or poorer lines and only a zero point shift can reasonably be
  determined.  Note that the zero point shift is in user coordinates.
  This is only an approximate correction for shifts in the raw spectra
  since these shifts are in pixels and the coordinate function should
  also be appropriately shifted.
  <P>
  One a set of features is defined one may select features for various
  operations.  To select feature as the current feature the keys <TT>'.'</TT>, <TT>'n'</TT>,
  <TT>'+'</TT>, and <TT>'-'</TT> are used.  The <TT>'.'</TT> selects the feature nearest the cursor, the
  <TT>'n'</TT> and <TT>'+'</TT> select the next feature, and the <TT>'-'</TT> selects the previous
  feature relative to the current feature in the feature list as ordered by
  pixel coordinate.  These keys are useful when redefining the user
  coordinate with the <TT>'u'</TT> key, changing the fitting weight of a feature with
  <TT>'v'</TT>, and when examining features in zoom mode.
  <P>
  Features may be deleted with the key <TT>'d'</TT>.  All features are deleted
  when the <TT>'a'</TT> key immediately precedes the delete key.  Deleting the
  features does not delete the coordinate function.  Features deleted in the
  curve fitting package also are removed from the feature list upon
  exiting the curve fitting package.
  <P>
  It is common to transfer the feature identifications and coordinate function
  from one image to another.  When a new image without a database entry
  is examined, such as when going to the next image in the input list,
  changing image lines or columns with <TT>'j'</TT>, <TT>'k'</TT> and <TT>'o'</TT>, or selecting
  a new image with the "<TT>:image</TT>" command, the current feature list and coordinate
  function are kept.  Alternatively, a database record from a different
  image may be read with the "<TT>:read</TT>" command.  When transferring feature
  identifications between images the feature coordinates will not agree exactly
  with the new image feature positions and several options are available to
  reregister the feature positions.  The key <TT>'c'</TT> centers the feature nearest
  the cursor using the current position as the starting point.  When preceded
  with the <TT>'a'</TT> key all the features are recentered (the user must refit
  the coordinate function if desired).  As an aside, the recentering
  function is also useful when the parameters governing the feature
  centering algorithm are changed.  An additional options is the "<TT>:add</TT>"
  command to add features from a database record.  This does not overwrite
  previous features (or the fitting functions) as does "<TT>:read</TT>".
  <P>
  The (c)entering function is applicable when the shift between the current
  and true feature positions is small.  Larger shifts may be determined
  automatically with the <TT>'s'</TT> or <TT>'x'</TT> keys.
  <P>
  A zero point shift is specified interactively with the <TT>'s'</TT> key by using the
  cursor to indicate the coordinate of a point in the spectrum.  If there are
  no features then the shift is exactly as marked by the cursor.  If there
  are features the specified shift is applied, the features are recentered,
  and the mean shift for all the features is determined.
  <P>
  The <TT>'x'</TT> key uses the automatic line identification algorithm (see
  <B>aidpars</B>) with the constraint that the dispersion is nearly the
  same and the is primarily a shift in the coordinate zero point.  If
  features are defined, normally by inheritance from another spectrum, then a
  first pass is done to identify those features in the spectrum.  Since this
  only works when the shifts are significantly less than the dispersion range
  of the spectrum (i.e. a significant number of features are in common) a
  second pass using the full coordinate line list is performed if a shift
  based on the features is not found.  After a shift is found any features
  remaining from the original list are recentered and a mean shift is
  computed.
  <P>
  In addition to the single keystroke commands there are commands initiated
  by the key <TT>':'</TT> (colon commands).  As with the keystroke commands there are
  a number of standard graphics features available beginning with "<TT>:.</TT>"
  (type "<TT>:.help</TT>" for these commands).  The identify colon commands
  allow the task parameter values to be listed and to be reset
  within the task.  A parameter is listed by typing its name.  The colon command
  "<TT>:show</TT>" lists all the parameters.  A parameter value is reset by
  typing the parameter name followed by the new value; for example
  "<TT>:match 10</TT>".  Other colon commands display the feature list (:features),
  control reading and writing records to the database (:read and :write),
  and set the graph display format.
  <P>
  The feature identification process for an image is completed by typing
  <TT>'q'</TT> to quit.  Attempting to quit an image without explicitly
  recording changes in the feature database produces a warning message
  unless the <I>autowrite</I> parameter is set.  If this parameter is
  not set a prompt is given asking whether to save the results otherwise
  the results are automatically saved.  Also
  the reference spectrum keyword REFSPEC is added to the image header at
  this time.  This is used by <B>refspectra</B> and <B>dispcor</B>.
  As an immediate exit the <TT>'I'</TT> interrupt key may be used.  This does not save
  the feature information and may leave the graphics in a confused state.

  <H3>Database records</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DATABASE RECORDS'>
  <UL>
  The database specified by the parameter <I>database</I> is a directory of
  simple text files.  The text files have names beginning with 'id' followed
  by the entry name, usually the name of the image.  The database text files
  consist of a number of records.  A record begins with a line starting with the
  keyword "<TT>begin</TT>".  The rest of the line is the record identifier.  Records
  read and written by <B>identify</B> have "<TT>identify</TT>" as the first word of the
  identifier.  Following this is a name which may be specified following the
  "<TT>:read</TT>" or "<TT>:write</TT>" commands.  If no name is specified then the image name
  is used.  For 1D spectra the database entry includes the aperture number
  and so to read a solution from a aperture different than the current image
  and aperture number must be specified.  For 2D/3D images the entry name
  has the 1D image section which is what is specified to read the entry.
  The lines following the record identifier contain
  the feature information and dispersion function coefficients.
  <P>
  The dispersion function is saved in the database as a series of
  coefficients.  The section containing the coefficients starts with the
  keyword "<TT>coefficients</TT>" and the number of coefficients.
  <P>
  The first four coefficients define the type of function, the order
  or number of spline pieces, and the range of the independent variable
  (the line or column coordinate along the dispersion).  The first
  coefficient is the function type code with values:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	Code	Type
  	   1	Chebyshev polynomial
  	   2	Legendre polynomial
  	   3	Cubic spline
  	   4	Linear spline
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The second coefficient is the order (actually the number of terms) of
  the polynomial or the number of pieces in the spline.
  <P>
  The next two coefficients are the range of the independent variable over
  which the function is defined.  These values are used to normalize the
  input variable to the range -1 to 1 in the polynomial functions.  If the
  independent variable is x and the normalized variable is n, then
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	n = (2 * x - (xmax + xmin)) / (xmax - xmin)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where xmin and xmax are the two coefficients.
  <P>
  The spline functions divide the range into the specified number of
  pieces.  A spline coordinate s and the nearest integer below s,
  denoted as j, are defined by
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	s = (x - xmin) / (xmax - xmin) * npieces
  	j = integer part of s
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where npieces are the number of pieces.
  <P>
  The remaining coefficients are those for the appropriate function.
  The number of coefficients is either the same as the function order
  for the polynomials, npieces+1 for the linear spline, or npieces + 3
  for the cubic spline.

  2.  For images which are two or three dimensional it is necessary to
  specify the image axis for the data vector and the number of pixels at each
