  <B>Sarith</B> performs arithmetic operations on spectra.  It is
  distinguished from <B>imarith</B> in that it includes unary operators, like
  <B>imfunction</B> but with some specific to astronomical spectra, and binary
  operations between two spectra are performed in dispersion coordinate space
  (typically wavelength) rather than logical pixel space.  In the latter case
  the spectra are checked for matching dispersion functions (which are not
  necessarily linear) and, if they don't match, the second operand is
  interpolated without flux conservation.  (If flux conservation is desired
  then the task <B>dispcor</B> should be used first.) Thus, the spectra may
  have different dispersion functions but the arithmetic is done at matching
  wavelengths.  The default interpolation function is a 5th order
  polynomial.  The choice of interpolation type is made with the package
  parameter "<TT>interp</TT>".  It may be set to "<TT>nearest</TT>", "<TT>linear</TT>", "<TT>spline3</TT>",
  "<TT>poly5</TT>", or "<TT>sinc</TT>".  Remember that this applies to all tasks which might
  need to interpolate spectra in the <B>onedspec</B> and associated packages.
  For a discussion of interpolation types see <B>onedspec</B>.
  <P>
  The unary operators operate on the spectra in the first operand list to
  produce the specified output spectra, which may be the same as the
  input spectra.  The operators include:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	abs  - absolute value
  	copy - copy (see also <B>scopy</B>)
  	dex  - decimal exponentiation (antilog of base 10 logarithm)
  	exp  - base e exponentiation (antilog of natural logarithm)
  	flam - convert F-nu to F-lambda
  	fnu  - convert F-lambda to F-nu
  	inv  - inverse
  	ln   - natural logarithm
  	log  - base 10 logarithm
  	lum  - convert magnitude to luminosity
  	mag  - convert luminosity to magnitude
  	sqrt - square root
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The luminosity to magnitude and magnitude to luminosity operators are
  based on the standard relation:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	mag = -2.5 * log (lum)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where the log is base 10.  The F-nu to F-lambda and F-lambda to F-nu
  operators are based on the relation:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	F-nu = F-lambda * lambda / nu
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where lambda is wavelength and nu is frequency (currently the wavelength
  is assumed to be Angstroms and so F-lambda is in units of per Angstrom
  and F-nu is in units of per Hertz).  In all the operators it is the
  responsibility of user as to the appropriateness of the operator to
  the input.
  <P>
  The binary operators operate on the spectra in the first operand list
  and the spectra or numerical constants in the second operand.  Numeric
  constants are equivalent to spectra having the specified value at all
  pixels.  The binary operators are the standard arithmetic ones plus
  exponentiation and replacement:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	replace - replace first operand values by second operand values
  	+       - addition
  	-       - subtraction
  	*       - multiplication
  	/       - division
  	^       - exponentiation
  </PRE>
  <P>
  If the second operand is a spectrum, as mentioned previously, it is
  interpolated, without flux conservation, to the dispersion
  function of the first operand spectrum if necessary.
  <P>
  There is a distinctions between the first operand and the second operand.
  The first operand must always be a spectrum.  It supplies the dispersion
  function to be matched by the second operand spectrum.  It also supplies
  a copy of it's image header when a new output spectrum is created.
  In cases where it is desired to have the second operand be the
  dispersion/header reference and/or the first operand be a constant
  the <I>reverse</I> parameter is used.  For example to subtract a
  spectrum from the constant 1:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; sarith 1 - spec invspec reverse+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  or to subtract two spectra using the subtractand as the dispersion
  reference:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; sarith spec1 - spec2 diff reverse+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  When a binary operation on a pair of spectra is performed the aperture
  numbers may be required to be the same if <I>ignoreaps</I> is no.  For
  images containing multiple spectra the apertures need not be in the
  same order but only that matching apertures exist.  If this parameter
  is set to yes then aperture numbers are ignored when the operation is
  performed.  For multiple spectra images the second operand spectra
  are matched by image line number rather than by aperture.  If the
  second operand image has fewer lines, often just one line, then the
  last line is used repeatedly.  This feature allows multiple spectra
  in the primary operand list to be operated upon by a single spectrum;
  for example to subtract one spectrum from all spectra in the
  in a multiple spectrum image.
  <P>
  If it is an error to perform an operation on certain data values, for
  example division by zero or the square root of a negative number,
  then the output value is given the value specified by the parameter
  <I>errval</I>.
  <P>
  A log of the operations performed may be printed to the standard
  output, which may then be redirected if desired, if the <I>verbose</I>
  parameter is set.  In the output the last bracketed number is the
  aperture number of the spectrum.
  <P>
  INPUT/OUTPUT
  <P>
  The arithmetic part of <B>sarith</B> is fairly straightforward and
  intuitive.  The selection of input spectra from input images and
  the placing of output spectra in output images can be more confusing
  because there are many possibilities.  This section concentrates
  on the topics of the input and output.  Since the concepts apply to all
  of the operators it simplifies things to think in terms of copying
  input spectra to output spectra; the "<TT>copy</TT>" operator.  Note that the
  task <B>scopy</B> is actually just this case of <B>sarith</B> with
  parameters set for copying.  While the discussion here is similar
  to that in the help for <B>scopy</B>, the examples for that task
  are more focused for illustrating this topic than the <B>sarith</B>
  examples which concentrate more on the arithmetic aspects of 
  the task.
  <P>
  Input spectra are specified by an image list which may include explicit
  image names, wildcard templates and @files containing image names.
  The image names may also include image sections such as to select portions of
  the wavelength coverage.  The input images may be either one or two
  dimensional spectra.  One dimensional spectra may be stored in
  individual one dimensional images or as lines in two (or three)
  dimensional images.  The one dimensional spectra are identified by
  an aperture number, which must be unique within an image, and a beam number.
  Two dimensional long slit and three dimensional Fabry-Perot spectra are
  treated, for the purpose of this
  task, as a collection of spectra with dispersion either along any axis
  specified by the DISPAXIS image header parameter
  or the <I>dispaxis</I> package parameter.  The aperture and band
  parameters specify a spatial position.  A number of adjacent
  lines, columns, and bands, specified by the <I>nsum</I> package parameter,
  will be summed to form an aperture spectrum.  If number is odd then the
  aperture/band number refers to the middle and if it is even it refers to the
  lower of the two middle lines or columns.
  <P>
  In the case of many spectra each stored in separate one dimensional
  images, the image names may be such that they have a common root name
  and a four digit aperture number extension.  This name syntax is
  called "<TT>onedspec</TT>" format.  Including such spectra in an
  input list may be accomplished either with wildcard templates such as
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	name*
  	name.????.imh
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where the image type extension "<TT>.imh</TT>" must be given to complete the
  template but the actual extension could also be that for an STF type
  image, or using an @file prepared with the task <B>names</B>.
  To generate this syntax for output images the <I>format</I> parameter
  is set to "<TT>onedspec</TT>" (this will be discussed further later).
  <P>
  From the input images one may select a range of wavelengths with the
  <I>w1</I> and <I>w2</I> parameters and a subset of spectra based on aperture and
  beam numbers using the <I>aperture</I> and <I>beam</I> parameters.
  If the wavelength range is specified as INDEF the full spectra are
  used without any resampling.  If the aperture and beam lists are not
  specified, an empty list, then all apertures and beams are selected.  The
  lists may be those spectra desired or the complement obtained by prefixing
  the list with <TT>'!'</TT>.  Only the selected wavelength range and spectra will
  be operated upon and passed on to the output images.
  <P>
  Specifying a wavelength range is fairly obvious except for the question
  of pixel sampling.  Either the pixels in the specified range are used
  without resampling or the pixels are resampled to correspond eactly
  to the requested range.  The choice is made with the <I>rebin</I> parameter.
  In the first case the nearest pixels to the specified wavelength
  endpoints are determined and those pixels and all those in between
  are used.  The dispersion relation is unchanged.  In the second case
  the spectra are reinterpolated to have the specified starting and
  ending wavelengths with the same number of pixels between those points
  as in the original spectrum.  The reinterpolation is done in either
  linear or log-linear dispersion.  The non-linear dispersion functions
  are interpolated to a linear dispersion.
  <P>
  Using <B>sarith</B> with long slit and Fabry-Perot images provides a quick
  and simple type of extraction as opposed to using the <B>apextract</B>
  package.  When summing it is often desired to start each aperture after the
  number of lines summed.  To do this specify a step size in the aperture/band
  list.  For example to extract columns 3 to 23 summing every 5 columns you
  would use an aperture list of "<TT>3-23x5</TT>" and an <I>nsum</I> of 5.  If you do
  not use the step in the aperture list you would extract the sum of columns
  1 to 5, then columns 2 to 6, and so on.
  <P>
  In the special case of subapertures extracted by <B>apextract</B>, related
  apertures are numbered using a modulus; for example apertures
  5, 1005, 2005.  To allow selecting all related apertures using a single
  aperture number the <I>apmodulus</I> parameter is used to specify the
  modulus factor; 1000 in the above example.  This is a very specialized
  feature which should be ignored by most users.
  <P>
  The output list of images may consist of an empty list, a single image,
  or a list of images matching the input list in number.  Note that it
  is the number of image names that matters and not the number of spectra
  since there may be any number of spectra in an image.  The empty list
  converts to the same list as the input and is shorthand for replacing
  the input image with the output image upon completion; therefore it
  is equivalent to the case of a matching list.  If the input
  consists of just one image then the distinction between a single
  output and a matching list is moot.  The interesting distinction is
  when there is an input list of two or more images.  The two cases
  are then a mapping of many-to-many or many-to-one.  Note that it is
  possible to have more complex mappings by repeating the same output
  name in a matching list provided clobbering, merging, and possibly
  renumbering is enabled.
  <P>
  In the case of a matching list, spectra from different input images
  will go to different output images.  In the case of a single output
  image all spectra will go to the same output image.  Note that in
  this discussion an output image when "<TT>onedspec</TT>" format is specified
  is actually a root name for possibly many images.  However,
  it should be thought of as a single image from the point of view
  of image lists.
  <P>
  When mapping many spectra to a single output image, which may have existing
  spectra if merging, there may be a conflict with repeated aperture
  numbers.  One option is to consecutively renumber the aperture numbers,
  including any previous spectra in the output image when merging and then
  continuing with the input spectra in the order in which they are selected.
  This is specified with the <I>renumber</I> parameter which renumbers
  beginning with 1.
  <P>
  Another options which may be used independently of renumbering or in
  conjunction with it is to add an offset as specified by the <I>offset</I>
  parameter.  This is last step in determining the output aperture
  numbers so that if used with the renumber option the final aperture
  numbers begin with one plus the offset.
  <P>
  It has been mentioned that it is possible to write and add to
  existing images.  If an output image exists an error will be
  printed unless the <I>clobber</I> parameter is set.  If clobbering
  is allowed then the existing output image will be replaced by the
  new output.  Rather than replacing an output image sometimes one
  wants to replace certain spectra or add new spectra.  This is
  done by selecting the <I>merge</I> option.  In this case if the output
  has a spectrum with the same aperture number as the input spectrum
  it is replaced by the input spectrum.  If the input spectrum aperture
  number is not in the output then the spectrum is added to the output
  image.  To add spectra with the same aperture number and not
  replace the one in the output use the <I>renumber</I> or
  <I>offset</I> options.

  The noise band in multispec data is only copied from the primary
