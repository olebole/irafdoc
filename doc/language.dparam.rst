  <UL>
  <I>Dparam</I> lists one or more parameter sets.  Psets are specified either by
  the name of the task with which the pset is associated, or by filename (pset
  files have the "<TT>.par</TT>" extension).  If a file type pset is listed the extension
  must be included, since it is the presence or absence of the filename
  extension which <B>dparam</B> uses to distinguish between task-psets and named
  (file) psets.
  <P>
  Each parameter is listed on a single line with the following format.
  The list of assignments is terminated by the string "<TT># EOF</TT>" so that programs
  reading the list from a stream can easily distinguish the end of the variable
  length list of parameters.
  <P>
  	task.param = value
  <P>
  Here "<TT>task.param</TT>" is the name of the parameter, and "<TT>value</TT>" is the current
  value of the parameter.  The assignment is skipped if the value is undefined.
  There is no way to distinguish between hidden parameters and query parameters.
  <P>
  The output from <B>dparam</B> is often used as input to programs, whereas
  the output from <B>lparam</B> is formatted in a way which makes it easier for
  humans to read.  For example, the output from <B>dparam</B> may be redirected
  into a file and used on the IRAF main command line to set the task's
  parameters, when debugging a task standalone.

  1. List the parameter for the task <I>delete</I>.  Note that the positional
  parameters are listed first, in the order in which they must be specified
  on the command line, followed by the hidden parameters.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; dparam delete
  	delete.files = "temp"
  	delete.go_ahead = yes
  	delete.verify = no
  	delete.default_action = yes
  	delete.allversions = yes
  	delete.subfiles = yes
  	delete.mode = "ql"
  	# EOF
  </PRE>
  <P>
  2. List the contents of the file pset "<TT>delete.par</TT>".  Named psets such as this
  are most commonly produced using the <B>":w filename"</B> colon command in
  <B>eparam</B>, e.g., to prepare several different versions of the parameter
  set for a task.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; dparam delete.par
