  Normally when a script task terminates any tasks, packages, environment
  variables, etc. defined during the execution of that task are discarded
  (in other words, the memory used by the task is freed).
  The <I>keep</I> command instructs the CL to retain the definitions after
  script termination.  Only one level of "<TT>keep</TT>" is achieved, e.g.,
  if a script with a keep is called from a higher level script, then when
  the higher level script terminates the task definitions will still be lost
  (unless this higher level script also uses <I>keep</I>).

  1. The most common use for <I>keep</I> is to retain a set of definitions
  in a script task.
