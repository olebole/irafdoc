  <I>Logout</I> causes the CL to shut itself down, regardless of how many
  packages may currently be active.  The only way to shut the CL down without
  killing it is to use <I>logout</I>; <I>bye</I> is not allowed to shut the
  CL down, since it would be too easy to enter it by accident (and it takes
  a while to log back in).
  <P>
  An error message will be printed if one attempts to log out of the CL while
  a device is still allocated.  The device should be deallocated and the
  <I>logout</I> repeated, else type <I>logout</I> several times and you will
  be permitted to logout with the device still allocated.
