  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  The <I>package</I> task creates a new package.
  The newly defined package becomes the current package, and the prompt
  is changed to use the first two characters of the package name.
  The package command does not define any tasks within the package, that
  is done by subsequent <I>task</I> declarations.  Subsequent <I>task</I>
  declarations will add tasks to the task list for the new package.
  <P>
  The new package remains the "<TT>current package</TT>" until another <I>package</I>
  command is entered, or until the task in which the package command was
  entered is terminated.
  Normally <I>package</I> will be used at the beginning of a script to define
  the package name.  It will be followed by one or more task definitions,
  and then by a <I>cl</I> or <I>clbye</I> to interpret user commands,
  until the command <I>bye</I> is entered by the user, at which time the
  package script task terminates, discarding the package and any associated
  definitions.

  All active packages must have unique names.  To eliminate the possibility
  of parameter file name collisions in UPARM, the three character string
  formed by concatenating the first two and final characters of the package
  name should be unique.
