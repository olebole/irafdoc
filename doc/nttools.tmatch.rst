  This task combines rows from two tables into one. Rows are combined by
  looking at each row in the first table and finding the row in the
  second table whose match columns are closest to those in the first.
  The distance between two rows is defined in the usual way to be the
  square root of the sum of the squares of the difference between the
  corresponding match columns. Rows are only written to the output table
  if the distance between them is less than the distance specified by
  maxnorm. This task converts match column units to degrees for the
  purpose of computing the distance if the column units are recognized
  angular units (seconds, minutes, degrees, hours, or radians or any
  abbreviation of these). If the column units are blank or some
  unrecognized string, no conversion is done. Thus, if the match column
  is in some recognized angular units, maxnorm should be specified in
  degrees.
  <P>
  Columns named by the parameters 'incol1' and 'incol2' will be copied to
  the output table. If these parameters are left blank, all columns will
  be copied to the output table. Columns will have the same name in the
  output table as in the input table, except that columns with the same
  name in both input tables will have the suffix "<TT>_1</TT>" and "<TT>_2</TT>" added to
  indicate which table they were copied from.
  <P>
  This task optionally allows you to supply a set of weighting factors
  that are multiplied by the difference between corresponding match
  columns when computing the distance. These factors can be used to
  supply units conversion when column units information is missing from
  the input table or as a way to weight information from columns
  containing distinct information. If factors are supplied, any column
  units information is ignored. If the factors are left bank, they are
  ignored and column units information is used to convert to degrees
  when possible.
  <P>
  If the match columns contain spherical coordinates, parameter 'sphere'
  should be set to yes so that the distance on a sphere can be computed.
  If the match columns do contain spherical units, the first column
  should be the longitude column (such as right ascension) and the
  second column should be the latitude column (such as declination).
  Columns should also be in some recognized angular units, or a
  conversion factor should be supplied explicitly.
  <P>
  The task optionally produces a diagnostic output file if a file name
  is supplied to parameter 'diagfile'. The diagnostic file contains the
  rows from the first table that were not matched, the cases where
  more than one row in the first table matched a single row in the
  second table, and the ten matched rows in the with the largest
  distance between them. Rows in the diagnostic output are identified by
  their table number and row number and optionally by the contents of
  the columns specified by the parameters 'nmcol1' and 'nmcol2'.
  <P>
  This task differs from tjoin in two respects. First tjoin combines
  tables on the basis of a single column, while this task can combine
  tables based on multiple columns. Second, tjoin places every
  combination of rows matching within the specified tolerance in the output
  table, while this task only puts the closest match in the output table.

  1. Two star catalogs are being matched. They both have the following
  columns:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  Name             CH*12      %12s ""
  RA               D        %10.1h hours
  Dec              D        %10.0h degrees
  V                R         %7.2f ""
  B-V              R         %7.2f ""
  U-B              R         %7.2f ""
  </PRE>
  <P>
  To find the best match between the catalogs within a ten arcsecond
  radius one would use the following command:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  tt&gt; tmatch catalog1.tab catalog2.tab match.tab \<BR>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; ra,dec ra,dec 0:00:10 sphere+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The search radius can either be supplied in sexagesimal notation, as
  above, or in decimal degrees.
  <P>
  2. Suppose the input catalogs did not contain units information, as
  would be the case if they were text files. The units conversion could
  then be supplied explicitly through the factor parameter:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  tt&gt; tmatch catalog1.tab catalog2.tab match.tab \<BR>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; ra,dec ra,dec 0:00:10 factor=15,1 sphere+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  3. Suppose we want the output table to only contain the name from the
  first catalog and get the rest of its information from the second
  catalog. This could be done with the following command:
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  tt&gt; tmatch catalog1.tab catalog2.tab match.tab \<BR>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; ra,dec ra,dec 0:00:10 incol1=name sphere+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  4. To get diagnostic output from the task, use the following command:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  tt&gt; tmatch catalog1.tab catalog2.tab match.tab ra,dec ra,dec \<BR>
  &gt;&gt;&gt; diag=diag.txt nmcol1=name nmcol2=name 0:00:10 sphere+
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The following is a subset of the diagnostic output produced:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  The following objects matched the same object:
  1:163 6601  GEM
  1:164 6601  GEM
  2:163 6601  GEM
  <P>
  <P>
  The following objects have the largest norms:
  Norm = 0.00253
  1:371 2319  SCO
  2:371 2319  SCO
  <P>
  Norm = 0.00247
  1:368 2101  SCO
  2:368 2101  SCO
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The number before the colon is the table number, the number after the
  colon is the row number, and the rest of the line is from the name
  column.
