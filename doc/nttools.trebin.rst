  This task resamples tables.
  The grid on which to interpolate an input table
  may be specified either by a table giving explicit values
  or by start, end, and step values for uniform spacing.
  The column names in the output table
  will be the same as in the input table.
  <P>
  If the independent variable column ('column')
  in the input table contains scalar values,
  each numeric column in the input table will be rebinned
  to the values of the output independent variable.
  Character and boolean columns
  will not be copied to the output table.
  Columns that contain arrays will also not be copied to output.
  On the other hand,
  if the input independent variable column contains arrays
  rather than scalar values,
  then each row of the input table will be rebinned individually.
  Scalar columns will be copied to output unchanged.
  Array columns which have the same length as 'column'
  will be rebinned and written to the output table;
  if the array size is not the same,
  the column will not be copied to output.
  <P>
  Except for function = "<TT>linear</TT>",
  the output values are obtained by interpolation, not by fitting.
  The distinction is important when rebinning to a spacing ('step')
  that is significantly coarser than the spacing of the input data.
  For functions other than linear,
  each interpolated value is obtained as follows.
  The values of the input data
  nearest the current output independent variable value (X) are selected;
  the input data are then interpolated at X
  to obtain the value to write to the output table.
  For function = "<TT>nearest</TT>", only one input point is used;
  for function = "<TT>poly3</TT>" or "<TT>spline</TT>", four input points are used.
  This is appropriate for rebinning
  to a spacing not much different from the input data.
  For resampling noisy data
  to a significantly wider spacing than the input data, however,
  these options will give very poor results.
  In the latter case, function = "<TT>linear</TT>" (the default) should be used.
  This option uses a linear fit to all the data
  within an interval of width 'step' centered on each output X value.
  If there are fewer than two input points in a given interval, however,
  the value is interpolated the same way as is done for the other functions;
  that is, the two input points nearest to X are selected,
  and the value is interpolated at X
  (note that these two points can be outside the 'step' interval).
  <P>
  A significant limitation to this task is that
  there is no option to conserve total counts.
  'trebin' averages the data values,
  rather than summing the input bins.
  What 'trebin' does is appropriate for flux-calibrated spectra,
  or for time series data expressed as count rate,
  but it would not be correct for data in counts,
  or for count rate spectra.

  The independent variable values

  The value to write to the output table
  for out of bounds independent variables depends on
  the 'extrapolate' and 'value' parameters.
  If 'extrapolate' is yes, then 'value' is ignored,
  and the interpolation function is used for extrapolation.
  If 'extrapolate' is no,
  then 'value' is written to each dependent variable column
  for each row that the independent variable
  is outside the range of values in the input table.
  Note that for columns of type integer or short,
  'value' should be within the range of possible values of that type,

  <UL>
  A column which contains an integer bit mask
  will be interpolated as if it were an ordinary numeric column,
  which is not the correct behavior.
  <P>
  Sometimes a table contains array columns
  where the allocated array size is (or can be)
  larger than the number of elements actually used.
  In this case, a scalar column might be used
  to specify the effective array length.
  The array size in the output table
  will typically be different from the array size in the input table;
  'trebin' will update the allocated array size,
  but it will not modify any scalar column that gives the effective array size.
