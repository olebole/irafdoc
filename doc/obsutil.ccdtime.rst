  <UL>
  A telescope, CCD detector, and list of filters is selected from a database
  to define the expected photon/electron count rates.  These rates along with
  a specified seeing and airmass are used to estimate the signal-to-noise
  ratio (SNR) for a stellar observation in each filter.  The output provides
  three results per filter; the exposure time to achieve a desired SNR for a
  given magnitude, the magnitude to achieve a desired SNR in a given time, and
  the SNR at a specified magnitude and exposure time.  With each of these,
  the number of star photons (or CCD electrons) in an area 1.4 times the
  square of the seeing, the number of sky photons per pixel, and the RMS noise
  contributions from photon noise in the star, the sky, and the detector
  noise from dark current and read out noise are given.  Note that least two
  of the time, magnitude, and signal-to-noise ratio must be specified but if
  one is INDEF then output with that quantity fixed will be skipped or, in
  other words, only the output where the quantity is computed is produced.
  <P>
  The calibration information needed to define the count rates are
  taken from a database file.  This file may be standard ones given in
  the logical directory "<TT>ccdtime$</TT>" or the user may create their own.
  The database contains entries organized by telescope name (which may
  include a focal ratio if there are multiple ones), detector name,
  and filter name.  One of the standard files may be used as a template.
  <P>
  The file is actually in free format with whitespace and comments ignored.
  However, following the template formatting makes it easy to see the logical
  structure.  All lines, except the "<TT>end</TT>" line which separates the different
  catagories of entries, consist of a keyword an equal sign, and a value
  separated by whitespace.  An entry begins with one of the keywords
  "<TT>telescope</TT>", "<TT>detector</TT>", or "<TT>filter</TT>" and ends with the beginning of
  a new entry or the "<TT>end</TT>" separator.
  <P>
  A keyword is one of the words shown in the example below.  These keywords
  can also be indexed by the name of a telescope, filter, and/or detector
  entry.  This allows having different transmissions in different filters
  due to correctors, different scales for different detectors which may
  have fore-optics, etc.
  <P>
  Specifically a keyword in the telescope section may have arguments
  from the filter or detector entries, a keyword in the filter section may
  have arguments from the telescope and detector entries, and a keyword
  in the detector section may have arguments from the telescope and filter
  entries.  The formats are keyword, keyword(arg), and keyword(arg,arg).
  The arg fields must match an entry name exactly (without the quotes)
  and there can be no whitespace between the keyword and (, between (
  and the argument, between the arguments and the comma, and between the
  last argument and the closing ).  The software will first look for
  keywords with both arguments in either order, then for keywords with
  one argument, and then for keywords with no arguments.
  <P>
  Below is an example of each type of entry:
  <P>
  <PRE>
      telescope = "0.9m"
  	    aperture = 0.91
  	    scale = 30.2
  	    transmission = 1.0
  	    transmission(U) = 0.8
  	    transmission(U,T1KA) = 0.7
  <P>
      filter = "U"
  	    mag = 20
  	    star = 18.0
  	    extinction = 0.2
  	    sky0 = 22.0
  	    sky1 = -0.2666
  	    sky2 = -.00760
  <P>
      detector = "T1KA"
  	    rdnoise = 3.5
  	    dark = 0.001
  	    pixsize = 24
  	    U = 0.36
  	    B = 0.61
  	    V = 0.71
  	    R = 0.78
  	    I = 0.60
  </PRE>
  <P>
  In the example, a transmission of 0.7 will be used if the filter is U
  and the detector is T1KA, a value of 0.8 if the filter is U and the
  detector is not T1KA, and a value of 1 for all other cases.
  <P>
  The telescope entry contains the aperture diameter in meters, the
  scale in arcsec/mm, and a transmission factor.  The transmission factor is
  mostly a fudge factor but may be useful if a telescope has various
  configurations with additional mirrors and optics.
  <P>
  The filter entry contains a fiducial magnitude and the total photon count
  rate for a star of that magnitude.  The units are photons per second
  per square meter of aperture.  An effective extinction in magnitudes/airmass is
  given here.  The sky is defined by a quadratic
  function of lunar phase in days:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	if (phase &lt; 14)
  	    sky = sky0 + sky1 * phase + sky2 * phase**2
  	else
  	    sky = sky0 + sky1 * (14 - phase) + sky2 * (14 - phase)**2
  </PRE>
  <P>
  One may set the higher order terms to zero if the moon contribution
  is to be ignored.  The units are magnitudes per square arc second.
  <P>
  The detector entry contains the read out noise in electrons, the
  dark current rate in electrons per second, the pixel size in
  microns, and the detective quantum efficiency (DQE); the fraction of
  detected photons converted to electrons.  Note that the actual
  values used are the DQE times the rates given by the filter entries.
  Thus, one may set the DQE values to 1 and adjust the filter values
  or set the star count rates to 1 in the filter and set the actual
  count rates in the DQE values.
  <P>
  The computed quantities are formally given as follows.  The
  star count rates for the specified telescope/detector/filter are:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	r(star) = star * aperture**2 * transmission *
  	    10**(0.4*(1-airmass)*extinction) * dqe
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where the "<TT>star</TT>", "<TT>aperture</TT>", "<TT>transmission</TT>", "<TT>extinction</TT>", are those
  in the database and the "<TT>dqe</TT>" is the appropriate filter value.  The sky
  rate per pixel is:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	r(sky) = r(star) * 10 ** (0.4 * (mag - sky)) * pixel**2
  	pixel = pixsize * scale * sum
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where mag is the fiducial magnitude, sky is the value computed using
  the quadratic formula for the specified moon phase and the database
  coefficients, the "<TT>pixel</TT>" size is computed using the CCD pixel size and
  the telescope scale from the database, and sum is the
  specified CCD binning factor.
  <P>
  The number of pixels per star is computed from the seeing as:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	npix = 1.4 * (seeing / pixel) ** 2
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where the number is rounded up to the next integer and a minimum of 9
  pixels is enforced.  This number is a compromise between a large aperture
  for high SNR stars and a smaller aperture for fainter stars.
  <P>
  The number of star photons/electrons per star of magnitude m,
  the number of sky photons per pixel, and the number of dark current
  electrons, all in exposure time t, are given by:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	nstar = r(star) * 10 ** (0.4 * (mag - m)) * t
  	nsky = r(sky) * t
  	ndark = dark * t
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where dark is taken from the detector database entry.
  <P>
  Finally the noise contributions, total noise, and signal-to-noise are
  given by:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	noise star = nstar ** 1/2
  	noise sky = (npix * nsky) ** 1/2
  	noise ccd = (npix * (ndark + rdnoise**2)) ** 1/2
  	noise total = (nstar+npix*(nsky+ndark+rdnoise**2)) ** 1/2
  	SNR = nstar / noise total
