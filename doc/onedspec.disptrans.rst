  The dispersion function in the input spectra, y = f(x) where x is the
  pixel coordinate and y is the input dispersion coordinate, is
  transformed to y' = g(x) where y' is in the new dispersion units.  This is done
  by evaluating the input dispersion coordinate y at each pixel, applying an
  air to vacuum or vacuum to air conversion if desired, and applying the
  specified unit transformation y' = h(y).  Since the transformations are
  nonlinear functions and the output dispersion function must be expressed in
  polynomial form, the function g(x) is determined by fitting a cubic spline
  to the set of x and y' values.  The lowest number of spline pieces is used
  which satisfies the specified error.  Note that this error is not a random
  error but difference between the smooth fitted function and the smooth
  dispersion function in the header.  As a special case, the first
  fit tried is a linear function.  If this satisfies the error condition
  then a simpler dispersion description is possible.  Also this is
  appropriate for dispersion units which are simply related by a
  scale change such as Angstroms to nanometers or Hertz to Mev.
  <P>
  The error condition is that the maximum difference between the exact or
  analytic (the air/vacuum conversion is never exact) transformation and the
  fitted function value at any pixel be less than the equivalent shift in
  pixel coordinate evaluated at that point.  The reason for using an error
  condition in terms of pixels is that it is independent of the dispersion of
  the spectra and the resolution of spectra is ultimately limited by the
  pixel sampling.
  <P>
  After the new dispersion function is determined the function is either
  stored in the coordinate system description for the spectrum or used to
  resample the pixels to linear increments in the output dispersion units.
  The resampling is not done if the new dispersion function is already linear
  as noted above.  The sampling uses the mean value over the input spectrum
  covered by an output spectrum pixel (it is flux per unit dispersion element
  preserving as opposed to flux/counts preserving).  The linear sampling
  parameters are limited to producing the same number of output pixels as
  input pixels over the same range of dispersion.  If one wants to have more
  control over the resampling then the <I>linearize</I> parameter should be
  set to no and the task <B>dispcor</B> used on the output spectrum.
  <P>
  Note that an alternative to using this task is to do the original
  dispersion calibration (based on calibration spectra) with IDENTIFY
  and DISPCOR in the desired units.  However, currently the standard
  lines lists are in Angstroms.  There are, however, linelists for
  He-Ne-Ar, Th-Ar, and Th in vacuum wavelengths.

  The dispersion units are specified by strings having a unit type from the
  list below along with the possible preceding modifiers, "<TT>inverse</TT>", to
  select the inverse of the unit and "<TT>log</TT>" to select logarithmic units. For
  example "<TT>log angstroms</TT>" to select the logarithm of wavelength in Angstroms
  and "<TT>inv microns</TT>" to select inverse microns.  The various identifiers may
  be abbreviated as words but the syntax is not sophisticated enough to
  recognized standard scientific abbreviations except for those given
  explicitly below.

  	   angstroms - Wavelength in Angstroms

  The velocity units require a trailing value and unit defining the
  velocity zero point.  For example to transform to velocity relative to
  a wavelength of 1 micron the unit string would be:

  The air to vacuum and vacuum to air conversions are obtained by multiplying
  or dividing by the air index of refraction as computed from the
  formulas in Allen's Astrophysical Quantities (p. 124 in 1973 edition).
  These formulas include temperature, pressure, and water vapour terms
  with the default values being the standard ones.
