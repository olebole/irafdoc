  <DD>List of input images containing spectra to be combined.  The spectra

  the associated band spectra are ignored.  This task does not work on
  higher dimensional spectra data.  To apply it first use a task to

  <CENTER>Scaling/Weighting Parameters
  
  </CENTER><BR>
  <P>
  The following scaling and weighting parameters have the following behavior
  and constraints, which are particularly relevant to multispec formats where
  multiple spectra are contained in an image with a single image header.
  When using image statistics these are calculated from the rebinned spectra
  being combined as expected.  When using header keywords the values will be
  the same for all spectra from the same input file.
  <P>
  When using a file then the list will be applied repeatedly to each
  group being combined.  If the grouping is by aperture then the values will
  be matched in the order of the input images.  Note that if an image does
  not contain a specified aperture the ordering will be wrong.  If the
  grouping is by image then the file will be matched to the spectra in the
  order of the apertures in the image.  And if the grouping is "<TT>all</TT>" then the
  list is matched in the order of the images and apertures within the
  images with the apertures in an image varying first.

  <B>Odcombine</B> combines input spectra by interpolating them (if necessary)
  to a common dispersion sampling, rejecting pixels exceeding specified low
  and high thresholds or identified as bad in a bad pixel mask, scaling them
  in various ways, applying a rejection algorithm based on known or empirical
  noise statistics, and computing the sum, weighted average, or median of the
  remaining pixels.  Note that the "<TT>sum</TT>" option is the direct summation of
  the pixels and does not perform any rejection or scaling of the data
  regardless of the parameter settings.
  <P>
  The input spectra are specified using an image list in which each image
  may contain multiple spectra.  The set of spectra may be restricted
  by the <I>aperture</I> parameter to specific apertures.  The set of input
  spectra may then be grouped using the <I>group</I> parameter and each
  group combined separately into final output spectra.  The grouping
  options are to select all the input spectra regardless of the input
  image or aperture number, select all spectra of the same aperture,
  or select all the spectra from the same input image.
  <P>
  The output consists of one image for each combined group.  The output
  images and combined spectra inherit the header parameters from the first
  spectrum in the combined group.  There are a number of additional optional
  outputs provided.  The optional logfile lists parameters, the spectra
  combined for each group, scaling, weights, etc., and the output names.
  <P>
  The spectral combining is done using pixels at common dispersion
  coordinates rather than physical or logical pixel coordinates.  If the
  spectra to be combined do not have identical dispersion coordinates then
  the spectra are interpolated to a common dispersion sampling before
  combining.  The interpolation conserves pixel values rather pixel fluxes.
  This means that flux calibrated data is treated correctly and that
  spectra in counts are not corrected in the interpolation for changes in
  pixel widths.  The default interpolation function is a 5th order
  polynomial.  The choice of interpolation type is made with the package
  parameter "<TT>interp</TT>".  It may be set to "<TT>nearest</TT>", "<TT>linear</TT>", "<TT>spline3</TT>",
  "<TT>poly5</TT>", or "<TT>sinc</TT>".  Remember that this applies to all tasks which might
  need to interpolate spectra in the <B>onedspec</B> and associated packages.
  For a discussion of interpolation types see <B>onedspec</B>.
  <P>
  There are two choices for the common dispersion coordinate sampling. If the
  <I>first</I> parameter is set then the dispersion sampling of the first
  spectrum is used.  If this dispersion is nonlinear then the end points and
  number of pixels are preserved and a linear dispersion is applied between
  the endpoints.  If the parameter is not set then the user specified linear
  or log linear dispersion system is used.  Any combination of starting
  wavelength, ending wavelength, wavelength per pixel, and number of output
  pixels may be specified.  Unspecified values will default to reasonable
  values based on the minimum or maximum wavelengths of all spectra, the
  minimum dispersion, and the number of pixels needed to satisfy the other
  parameters.  If the parameters overspecify the linear system then the
  ending wavelength is adjusted based on the other parameters.  Note that for
  a log linear system the wavelengths are still specified in nonlog units and
  the dispersion is finally recalculated using the difference of the log
  wavelength endpoints divided by the number pixel intervals (the number of
  pixels minus one).
  <P>
  This task is layered on top of the <B>imcombine</B> task.  What happens
  is that the spectra for each group to be combined is extracted from
  the input, resampled to a common dispersion, and the resulting spectra
  written to temporary images, one per spectrum.  The temporary images
  are written to the current working directory with names begining with
  "<TT>tmp</TT>".  The same is done with any bad pixel masks.  Then the list of
  images are combined using the IMCOMBINE algorithms.  When the combining
  is completed the temporary images are removed.  If ODCOMBINE aborts
  for some reason these file may be left behind and the user may delete
  them.  Details of what IMCOMBINE does are presented separate under the
  help topic for the IMCOMBINE task.
