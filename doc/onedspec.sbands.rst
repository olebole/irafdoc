  <B>Sbands</B> performs bandpass spectrophotometry with one or more bandpasses
  on one or more spectra.  A list of input spectra is specified.  The spectra
  may be of any type acceptable in the <B>noao.onedspec</B> package including
  multispec format with nonlinear dispersion, long slit spectra, and even
  3D cubes with one dispersion axis.  The <I>apertures</I> parameter allows
  selecting a subset of the spectra by aperture number.
  <P>
  The bandpasses are specified in a text file.  A bandpass consists of four
  fields; an identification name, the wavelength of the bandpass center, a
  bandpass width, and a filename for a filter.  The identification is a
  string which must be quoted if a null name or a name with whitespace is
  desired.  The identification could be given as the central wavelength if
  nothing else is appropriate.  The filter field is a filename for a text
  file containing the filter values.  A filter file consists of a wavelength
  ordered list of wavelength and relative response.  Extrapolation uses the
  end point values and interpolation is linear.  The special name "<TT>none</TT>" is
  used if there is no filter.  This is equivalent to unit response at all
  wavelengths.
  <P>
  In the bandpass file there may be one, two, or three bandpasses on
  a line.  Below are some examples of the three cases:
  <P>
  <PRE>
     alpha 5000 10 myalpha.dat
     beta1 4000 100 none	     beta2 4100 100 none
     line  4500 100 none	     red   4000 200 none blue 5000 200 none
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The flux in each bandpass is measured by summing each pixel in the interval
  multiplied by the interpolated filter response at that pixel.  At the edges
  of the bandpass the fraction of the pixel in the bandpass is used.  If the
  bandpass goes outside the range of the data an INDEF value will be reported.
  If the <I>normalize</I> option is yes then the total flux is divided by
  the sum of the filter response values.  If the <I>mag</I> option is
  yes the flux will be converted to a magnitude (provided it is positive)
  using the formula
  <P>
  <PRE>
      magnitude = magzero - 2.5 * log10 (flux)
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where <I>magzero</I> is a parameter for the zero point magnitude and log10
  is the base 10 logarithm.  Note that there is no attempt to deal with the
  pixel flux units.  This is the responsibility of the user.
  <P>
  If there is only one bandpass (on one line of the band file) then only
  the band flux or magnitude is reported.  If there are two bandpasses
  the fluxes or magnitudes for the two bands are reported as well as a
  band index, the flux ratio or magnitude difference (depending on the <I>mag</I>)
  flag, and an equivalent width using the second band as the continuum.
  If there are three bandpasses then a continuum bandpass flux is computed
  as the interpolation between the bandpass centers to the center of the
  first bandpass.  The special bandpass identification "<TT>cont</TT>" will
  be reported.
  <P>
  The equivalent width is obtained from the two bandpasses by the
  formula
  <P>
  <PRE>
      eq. width = (1 - flux1 / flux2) * width1
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where flux1 and flux2 are the two bandpass fluxes and width1 is the
  width of the first bandpass.  Note that for this to be meaningful
  the bandpasses should be normalized or have the same width/response.
  <P>
  The results of measuring each bandpass in each spectrum are written
  to the specified output file.  This file may be given as "<TT>STDOUT</TT>" to
  write the results to the terminal.  The output file contains lines
  with the spectrum name and aperture, the band identifications and
  fluxes or magnitudes, and the band index and equivalent width (if
  appropriate).  The <I>verbose</I> option allows creating a more
  documented output by including a commented header with the task
  name and parameters, the bandpass definitions, and column labels.
  The examples below show the form of the output.
