  APFILE takes a list of user generated text files <I>photfiles</I>, 
  containing image names or ids, x and y coordinates, filter ids, exposure times,
  airmasses, times of observation, aperture radii, measured magnitudes,
  and magnitude errors for
  one or more stars in one or more images, computes the aperture correction
  between the apertures <I>smallap</I> and <I>largeap</I> for each image using
  a weighted average of the computed model curve of growth and the observed
  curve of growth, and writes the results to <I>apercors</I>.
  <P>
  APFILE computes the aperture corrections by performing the following steps:
  1) extracts the image names or ids,  x and y coordinates, filter ids, exposure
  times, airmasses, times of observation
  and <I>naperts</I> aperture radii, measured magnitudes,
  and magnitude errors for all the objects in <I>photfiles</I>, 2) rejects data
  for all aperture radii greater than any aperture radius for which the magnitude
  or magnitude error is INDEF, the magnitude error is &gt; <I>maglim</I>,
  or the number of apertures left containing good data is &lt; 2, 
  3) adds in quadrature a magnitude error of 0.001 magnitudes to the extracted
  magnitude errors, 4) edits any incorrect or undefined values of
  the filter id, exposure time, airmass, and time of observation
  in <I>photfiles</I> using the values
  in <I>obsparams</I> if defined, or default values of INDEF, 1.0, 1.25, and INDEF
  respectively, 5) computes the theoretical and observed curve of growth
  curve for each image, 6) computes the adopted curve of growth for each
  image by combining the theoretical and observed curves with weights that
  favor the observed curve at smaller aperture radii and the theoretical curve
  at larger aperture radii, 7) integrates the adopted growth curve between
  the <I>smallap</I> and <I>largeap</I> apertures to
  compute the final aperture correction, 8) writes the results for each image
  to <I>apercors</I>, 9) optionally computes magnitudes for all the stars
  in <I>photfiles</I> corrected to <I>largeap</I> using the observed magnitude
  and computed correction for which the signal to noise is highest,
  10) optionally writes a <I>logfile</I> containing the details of the
  fit for all the individual images, 11) optionally writes a file of
  plots of the fit, the residuals, and the curve of growth for all the
  images.
  <P>
  The parameter <I>incolumns</I> describes the format of <I>photfiles</I>.
  <I>Incolumns</I> is a list of 9 numbers separated by commas or
  whitespace which specify the columns containing the following quantities:
  the image name or id, , the x coordinate, the y coordinate, the filter
  id, the exposure time, the airmass, the time of observation,
  the first aperture radius extracted,
  the first measured magnitude extracted,
  and the first magnitude error extracted. The number of aperture radii,
  magnitudes, and magnitude errors extracted are specified by <I>naperts</I>.
  For example if <I>incolumns</I> is "<TT>1,3,4,0,0,2,5,0,20,35</TT>" and <I>naperts</I>
  is 15, then the image name is assumed to be in column 1,
  the x and y coordinates in columns 3 and 4, the filter id, exposure time,
  and time of exposure
  are missing and will be assigned values of INDEF, 1.0, and INDEF respectively,
  the airmass is in column 2, the aperture
  radii in columns 5-19, the magnitudes in columns 20-34, and the magnitude
  errors in columns 35-49.  The aperture radii must be written in
  <I>photfiles</I> in increasing order of size. The columns image name,
  x coordinate, y coordinate, aperture radii, magnitude, and magnitude error
  are mandatory and must be present in <I>photfiles</I>. The filter id,
  exposure time, and airmass columns are optional in which case they
  may be represented by a "<TT>0</TT>" in the appropriate place in <I>incolumns</I>.
  <P>
  Values of the filter ids, exposure times, airmasses, and times of observation
  which are undefined
  or incorrect in <I>photfiles</I>, can be entered or corrected by reading values
  from the file <I>obsparams</I> a simple multi-column text file with a
  format specified by <I>obscolumns</I>.
  If no values are read from <I>photfiles</I> or <I>obsparams</I> default values
  for the filter id, exposure time, airmass, and time of observation
  of "<TT>INDEF</TT>", 1.0, 1.25, "<TT>INDEF</TT>" respectively will be assigned.
  It must be emphasized that the airmass is actually used in the curve of
  growth analysis only if <I>nparams</I> is equal to
  5, and that the quantities filter id and exposure time are not used in
  the analysis at all. However if the user should wish to use the corrected
  magnitudes optionally computed and written to <I>magfile</I> in any subsequent
  analysis it is important to include the correct values of
  these quantities in <I>magfile</I>. 
  <P>
  If <I>interactive</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", the user can interact with the curve of
  growth fitting process by examining plots of the model fit, the residuals
  versus aperture radius, magnitude in the first aperture, x and y coordinates,
  and the aperture correction
  as a function of radius, by changing the number of parameters to be fit and
  their initial values, deleting and undeleting points with the graphics
  cursor, refitting the model curve of growth and reexamining the results
  until satisfied. Users must realize that when deleting and undeleting
  points with the graphics cursor data for all the apertures above
  the one being deleted or undeleted will also be deleted.
  <P>
  The output aperture corrections file <I>apercors</I> is a simple text
  file containing the image name in column 1, the aperture correction
  computed from <I>smallap</I> to <I>largeap</I> in column 2, and the
  estimated error in the aperture correction in column 3.
  The sign of the aperture correction is such that the
  correction must be added to the observed magnitude to compute the corrected
  magnitude. <I>Apercors</I> is written in a form suitable for input to
  the MKNOBSILE, MKOBSFILE, or OBSFILE tasks.
  <P>
  If <I>magfile</I> is not "<TT></TT>", a file containing the image name or id, x and y
  position, filter id, exposure time, airmass, magnitude corrected to
  <I>largeap</I> using the observed magnitude and computed correction at the
  aperture radius with the highest signal-to-noise ratio, and the associated
  magnitude error, for all the stars in all the images in <I>photfiles</I>.
  <I>Magfile</I> is written in a form suitable for input to the OBSFILE task.
  <P>
  If <I>logfile</I> is not "<TT></TT>", all the details and diagnostics of the
  curve of growth fit are logged either to a new file, if <I>append</I> = "<TT>no</TT>"
  or to a previously existing file, <I>append</I> = "<TT>yes</TT>". The output
  consists of: 1) a banner listing
  the date, time, and <I>apercors</I> for which the entry is relevant, 2)
  a listing of the number of parameters <I>nparams</I> in the five parameter
  curve of growth model to be fit, the initial values of all the parameters, and
  the small and large aperture numbers, 3) the fitted values of the
  curve of growth model parameters and their errors where parameters which
  were not fit have zero-valued errors, 4) the computed seeing radius
  for each image,
  5) the theoretical, observed, and adopted curves of growth and
  their associated errors, 6) the aperture correction to  largeap,
  the estimated total aperture correction to an
  aperture radius twice the largest aperture radius, and the estimated error
  in the aperture correction, 7) the aperture
  correction from <I>smallap</I> to <I>largeap</I>, 8) for each star
  in the image the observed magnitudes, magnitude corrected to the largest
  aperture, and magnitude corrected to twice the largest aperture, and
  finally, 9) a summary of the mean adopted curve of growth, the mean residual,
  and the mean residual squared for all the data for all the images
  as a function of aperture radius.
  <P>
  If <I>plotfile</I> is not "<TT></TT>", plots of the final curve of growth model fit,
  residuals as a function of aperture radius, magnitude, x, y, and the
  aperture correction to the largest aperture <I>largeap</I>
  for each image in <I>photfiles</I> are saved in the plot metacode file

  In a given run of APFILE the seeing radius
  RO[i] is fit separately for each image, but the parameters swings, pwings,
  pgauss, rgescale, and xwings are fit to the entire data set. Therefore
  the RO[i] values define a family curves, each differing from the other
  by the seeing radius RO[i] alone. It turns out that for most data the
  fits do not depend significantly on the <I>rgescale</I> and <I>xwings</I>
  parameters.  Therefore by default <I>nparams</I> is set to 3 and
  <I>rgescale</I> and <I>xwings</I> are set to default values of 0.9 and 0.0
  respectively.
  <P>
  After the theoretical and observed growth curves are computed for
  each image, they are combined to produce an adopted growth curve. The
  weighting scheme used in the combining process is such that at small radii
  where the observed magnitude differences have the smallest errors,
  the observed values,
  are favored, and at large radii  the theoretical curve is favored. At
  all points in the computation of the theoretical curve, the observed curve,
  and the adopted curve, tests are made for deviant data points and these
  are down-weighted. The adopted curve is integrated between <I>smallap
  and fIlargeap</I> to produce the aperture correction for each image.
  <P>
  Because the error in the observed magnitudes grows rapidly toward
  larger radii, while the error in the aperture correction grows
  rapidly toward smaller radii, the combined error for the star will
  have some minimum value, usually at an intermediate aperture. If
  <I>magfile</I> is not "<TT></TT>", the magnitudes corrected to <I>largeap</I>

  1. Prepare an aperture corrections file from a set of observations
  from 5 different data frames taken in a single night. The input
  photometry files contain the image ids in column 1, the x and y positions
  in columns 3 and 4, the airmass in column 2, and the 15 aperture radii,
  magnitudes, and magnitude errors in columns 5-19,20-34,35-49 respectively.

  3. Compute the magnitudes corrected to largeap, of all the standard
  stars observed in a night using the observed magnitude and computed magnitude
  correction at the aperture radius with the lowest error. Assume that the
  format of the input photometry files is the same as in the two previous
  examples and the filter ids (U,B,V), exposure times, and airmasses were
  all present and correct in the photometry files.
