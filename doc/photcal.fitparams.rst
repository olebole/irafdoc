  FITPARAMS parses the configuration file <I>config</I> checking for
  grammar and syntax errors.  FITPARAMS attempts to recover from any
  errors and to finish parsing the configuration
  file, but it will not process the input data if errors are present.
  The configuration file is described briefly in the configuration file
  section and in detail in the help page for the configuration file.
  <P>
  Once the configuration file is successfully parsed, FITPARAMS reads the list
  of catalog files and loads the values of the catalog variables
  declared in <I>config</I> into memory.
  If no catalog section is declared in <I>config</I>, if the catalog section
  is empty, or if catalogs is "<TT></TT>", no catalog data is read
  and all the required input data is assumed to be in <I>observations</I>.
  After the catalog data is read, FITPARAMS reads the observations files
  <I>observations</I>, matches the object ids of the observations with the
  corresponding catalog object ids, and loads all the observations
  variables declared in <I>config</I> into memory. Id matching is disabled
  if no catalog
  data is read, otherwise only those observations which have a matching catalog
  entry will be used in the fit. If a catalog section declaration was made
  in <I>config</I>, even an empty one, FITPARAMS assumes that the object ids
  are in column 1 of <I>observations</I>.
  <P>
  Legal <I>catalog</I> and <I>observations</I> files are multi-column text
  files whose columns are delimited by whitespace.
  The first column of a catalog file is <I>always</I> reserved for an object id.
  The first column of an observations file is <I>usually</I> reserved for an
  object id which can be
  used to match the observational data with the corresponding catalog data.
  All other columns may contain any quantity which can be
  expressed as an integer or real number.  Sexagesimal format numbers
  (hh:mm:ss) are interpreted internally as real numbers. The constant
  INDEF can be used to represent data that is missing or undefined.
  Double precision and complex data are
  not supported. Lines beginning with "<TT>#</TT>" are treated as comment lines.
  <P>
  FITPARAMS solves the fit
  for each equation in the configuration file either interactively 
  or non-interactively depending on the value of <I>interactive</I>,
  and writes the solution in the output file <I>parameters</I> for later
  use by the evaluation routines EVALFIT or INVERTFIT.
  Selected results can also be written to <I>logfile</I> if
  any of the switches <I>log_unmatched</I>, <I>log_fit</I>, or <I>log_results</I>
  are enabled.
  In interactive mode the user can use all the interactive capabilities
  of the interactive non-linear least squares package INLFIT.
  INLFIT is described more fully below.

  <P>
  The configuration file is a text file which specifies how the data is
  organized in the input files and how the transformation
  equations are to be fit.
  <P>
  The input data are assumed to come from two different sources that may
  be either in the same input file or in different input files.
  These sources are known as the <I>catalog</I> and the <I>observations</I>
  respectively.
  <P>
  The <I>catalog</I> contains values indexed by a name called the
  matching name. This name must be in the first column of the
  catalog and is also assumed to be unique, i.e, each catalog
  entry is assumed to be unique.
  <P>
  The <I>observations</I> are values that may be either indexed by a matching
  name if a catalog section is specified in the configuration file, or a
  stream of input values in an ordinary text file.
  If a catalog section is specified and non-empty, each observation is
  matched against the
  catalog entries, and only observations whose matching names are found in the
  catalog are used to compute the transformation equations.
  Otherwise all values are used.
  <P>
  The configuration file is divided in three sections: the <I>catalog
  section</I> which describes the format of the catalog files, the
  <I>observations section</I> which describes the format of the observation 
  files, and the <I>transformation section</I> which defines the
  transformation equations in that order.
  <P>
  The catalog and observations sections permit the user to assign
  names to the input file 
  columns. These columns can later be referenced by name in the configuration
  file by using these assigned names
  as if they were variables in a programming language.
  <P>
  The transformation section is used to define the equations to solve,
  and assign initial values to the fitting parameters.
  The user may also optionally define equations for the derivatives of
  the transformation equations with respect to the parameters,
  the weights to be used in the fit, 
  the errors of the fit and the default equations to be
  plotted in the interactive fitting process.
  It is possible to specify any number of transformation equations in
  this section.

  DESCRIPTION
  <P>
  INLFIT fits an n-dimensional function to a set data
  points, iterating until the reduced chi-squared changes
  by less than <I>tolerance</I> percent between successive iterations, or
  machine precision is reached and the fit converges, or until the maximum number
  of iterations <I>maxiter</I> is reached.  If the maximum number
  of iterations is reached before convergence a status flag
  is set.
  <P>
  After computing an initial fit, INLFIT presents the user with a plot of
  the fit and activates the graphics cursor.
  At this point the user may examine and/or interact with the fit by,
  for example, reprogramming the default graph keys,
  editing the default convergence or bad data rejection parameters,
  deleting and undeleting points, 
  altering which parameters in the fitting function are actually to be
  fit and which are to be held constant, and refitting the data.
  <P>
  If <I>nreject</I> is greater than zero the RMS of the residuals is computed
  and points whose residuals are less than <I>low_reject</I> * RMS
  or <I>high_reject</I> * RMS value are excluded from the fit. Points within
  a distance <I>grow</I> of a rejected point are also excluded from
  the fit. The function is then refit without the rejected points.
  The rejection algorithm is executed until the number of rejection
  iterations reaches <I>nreject</I> or no more points are rejected.
  <P>
  ALGORITHMS
  <P>
  INLFIT uses the standard Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares
  algorithm to fit the data. Detailed descriptions of the algorithm can
  be found in the following two references.
