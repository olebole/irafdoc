  INVERTFIT computes magnitudes and colors for the standard or
  program stars in <I>observations</I> by inverting the system of
  transformation equations defined in <I>config</I>, using the
  parameter values in the file <I>parameters</I> produced by the FITPARAMS
  task, and writes the fitted values to the output file <I>calib</I>.
  If <I>append</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>" output may be appended to an existing file.
  <P>
  INVERTFIT computes the values of the catalog variables for the program
  stars by inverting the system of transformation equations defined in
  <I>config</I>. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER TO ENSURE THAT
  THE SYSTEM OF EQUATIONS IS ACTUALLY INVERTIBLE.
  Two minimum conditions must be met. First, the number of
  transformation equations must be greater than or equal to the number of
  catalog variables to be fit, and second, all the catalog variables must
  be on the right-hand side of the transformation equations.
  INVERTFIT will test for both of these conditions, issue a warning, and
  terminate execution if either of these conditions are not met.
  <P>
  Below are two sets of transformation equations.
  The first set
  can be inverted by INVERTFIT, the second set cannot and must be
  evaluated by EVALFIT. In both cases the catalog variables to be fit
  are V and BV, and the observed quantities are mv, mb, Xv, and Xb.
  <P>
  <PRE>
      System 1:    mv = v0 + V + v1 * Xv + v2 * BV
  		 mb = b0 + V + BV + b1 * Xb + b2 * BV
  <P>
      System 2:    V = v0 + mv + v1 * (Xv + Xb) / 2. + v2 * (mb - mv)
  		 BV = b0 + b1 * (Xv + Xb) / 2.0 + b2 * (mb - mv) 
  </PRE>
  <P>
  It is possible though not recommended, to use set equation variables as
  unknowns in the transformation
  equations, provided that the total number of unknowns on the right-hand
  side of the equations remains less than or equal to the number of transformation
  equations. Set equations containing catalog variables must not be used
  in the left-hand side of the transformation equations. An example of a set
  of transformation equations which use a set equation variable is shown
  below. Note that there still are only two independent variables V and BV and
  that the output file <I>calib</I> will contain V and BV only.
  <P>
  <PRE>
      System 1:    set B = V + BV
      		 mv = v0 + V + v1 * Xv + v2 * BV
  		 mb = b0 + B + b1 * Xb + b2 * BV
  </PRE>
  <P>
  Some systems of equations are invertible but do not have a UNIQUE solution.
  A sample of such a system is shown below.
  There are quadratic terms in BV, implying that this set of
  equations probably has two solutions, both of which may be
  be mathematically correct, but only one of which is physically meaningful.
  INVERTFIT does not test for this condition and may converge to either solution.
  <P>
  <PRE>
      System 1: mv = v0 + V + v1 * BV + v2 * BV ** 2
  	      mb = b0 + V + BV + b1 * BV + b2 * BV ** 2
  </PRE>
   
  <P>
  Formal errors for the fit may
  be computed by,  1) setting <I>errors</I> to "<TT>obserrors</TT>" and using the
  error columns defined in the observations section of <I>config</I>
  to estimate the errors or 2) setting <I>errors</I> to "<TT>equations</TT>" and
  using the error equations defined in <I>config</I> to estimate the errors.
  <P>
  If the user wishes to match the objects in <I>observations</I> with those
  in <I>catalogs</I> in order for example, to compute the residuals of the fit,
  <I>catalogs</I> must be defined. Similarly if <I>objects</I> is "<TT>program</TT>"
  or "<TT>standard</TT>", <I>catalogs</I> must be defined in order to enable
  id matching.
  <P>
  Legal <I>catalog</I> and <I>observations</I> files are multi-column text
  files whose columns are delimited by whitespace.
  The first column of a catalog file is <I>always</I> reserved for an object id.
  The first column of an observations file is reserved for an
  object id which can be
  used to match the observational data with the catalog data.
  All other columns may contain any quantity which can be
  expressed as an integer or real number.  Sexagesimal format numbers
  (hh:mm:ss) are interpreted internally as real numbers. The constant
  INDEF can be used to represent data that is missing or undefined.
  Double precision and complex data are
  not supported. Lines beginning with "<TT>#</TT>" are treated as comment lines.
  <P>
  By default INVERTFIT prints out the id,
  followed by the variables listed in the <I>print</I>
  parameter, followed by the fit value, estimated
  error (if <I>errors</I> is "<TT>undefined</TT>", and residual of the fit (for any
  standard star observations that can be matched with the catalog values)
  for each fitted catalog variable.
  The user can format the output by setting the <I>format</I> parameter to an SPP
  style string. SPP format strings are described in detail below.

  A format specification has the form "<TT>%w.dCn</TT>", where w is the field width,
  d is the number of decimal places or the number of digits of precision,
  C is the format code, and n is radix character for format code "<TT>r</TT>" only.
  The w and d fields are optional.  The format codes C are as follows:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  b	boolean (YES or NO)
  c	single character (c or '\c' or '\0nnn')
  d	decimal integer
  e	exponential format (D specifies the precision)
  f	fixed format (D specifies the number of decimal places)

  h	hms format (hh:mm:ss.ss, D = no. decimal places)
  m	minutes, seconds (or hours, minutes) (mm:ss.ss)
  o	octal integer
  rN	convert integer in any radix N

  t	advance To column given as field W
  u	unsigned decimal integer 
  w	output the number of spaces given by field W
  x	hexadecimal integer
  z	complex format (r,r) (D = precision)

  <P>
  Conventions for w (field width) specification:
  <P>
      W =  n	right justify in field of N characters, blank fill
  	-n	left justify in field of N characters, blank fill
  	0n	zero fill at left (only if right justified)
  absent, 0	use as much space as needed (D field sets precision)

  formfeed
  \n	newline (crlf)
  \r	carriage return
  \t	tab
  \"	string delimiter character
  \'	character constant delimiter character
  \\	backslash character
  \nnn	octal value of character
