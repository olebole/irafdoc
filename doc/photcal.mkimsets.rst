  MKIMSETS is a script task which takes as input a list of
  the image names and filter ids, <I>imlist</I>, associated
  with objects whose magnitudes have been measured with APPHOT, DAOPHOT,
  or a user program, and produces the image set file <I>imsets</I> 
  required as input by the preprocessor tasks MKNOBSFILE or OBSFILE.
  MKIMSETS is used in conjunction with MKNOBSFILE OR OBSFILE to combine many
  individual digital photometry measurements, for example standard star
  measurements,
  into a single observations file. The source of the input image list is
  a list of IRAF images if <I>input</I> is "<TT>images</TT>",
  a list of APPHOT or DAOPHOT database files if <I>input</I> is "<TT>photfiles</TT>",
  or a user supplied text file if <I>input</I> is "<TT>user</TT>".
  <P>
  The output image set file <I>imsets</I> lists each observation of
  each star field, assigns a name supplied by the user
  to each observation, and specifies which images belong to the same
  observation of that star field.
  In the case of image sets which contain a single standard star measurement,
  the image set name should
  match the name of the standard star in the standard star catalog.
  <P>
  The optional output image observing parameters file <I>imobsparams</I>
  lists each unique image in <I>imlist</I>, its
  filter id <I>filter</I>, and other user specified fields <I>fields</I>.
  <I>Imobsparams</I> may be edited by
  the user, and used by the preprocessor tasks MKNOBSFILE or OBSFILE
  to correct erroneous or undefined values of
  filter id, exposure time, airmass and time of observation in the input
  databases.  By default <I>imobsparams</I> is not written.
  <P>
  After task initialization, MKIMSETS extracts each unique image name,
  the corresponding filter id stored in column <I>filter</I>,
  and the corresponding values of the user defined fields <I>fields</I>,
  from the input list <I>imlist</I>, and writes the resulting image list
  in tabular form to a temporary file.
  The temporary image list file contains the image name in column 1,
  the value of <I>filter</I> in column 2, and the values of
  any additional fields in succeeding columns in the order they were
  specified in <I>fields</I>.
  <P>
  If <I>sort</I> is one of the extracted
  fields "<TT>image</TT>", <I>filter</I>, or <I>fields</I>, MKIMSETS sorts the image
  list based on the values of <I>sort</I>, before writing the results to the
  the temporary image list file.
  <P>
  If <I>edit</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", the user enters the text editor and edits the
  temporary image list interactively.
  The image list must be arranged so that members of each image set are
  adjacent to each other in the image list.
  Missing images may be represented by
  an INDEF in column 1, the appropriate filter id in column 2, and
  INDEF in any other columns.
  The edit step is necessary if the image names are not in any logical
  order in <I>imlist</I> for <I>input</I> = "<TT>images</TT>",
  do not occur in any logical order in the APPHOT/DAOPHOT 
  databases for <I>input</I> = "<TT>photfiles</TT>", or are not listed logically
  in <I>imlist</I> for <I>input</I> = "<TT>user</TT>".
  At this point MKIMSETS saves the temporary image list in the text file
  <I>imobsparams</I>, if <I>imobsparams</I> is defined.
  <P>
  After the initial edit, MKIMSETS groups the images in the temporary image list,
  by using the filter ids in <I>idfilters</I>, and assuming that the image
  names are in logical order.
  If <I>rename</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", MKIMSETS prompts the user for the name of each 
  image set. Otherwise the default names OBS1, OBS2, ..., OBSN are
  assigned.
  If <I>review</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", MKIMSETS enters the editor, permitting the user
  to review <I>imsets</I> and interactively
  correct any mistakes.
  Image sets are written to <I>imsets</I>, 1 set
  per line with the image set name in column 1, a colon in column 2,
  followed by, in filter order and separated by whitespace, the names of the
  images of that field, for that  observation.

  1. Create an image set file from a list of APPHOT databases which
  contain UBV observations of 5 standard stars. The UBV filters are
  identified in the APPHOT databases by the filters ids "<TT>1</TT>","<TT>2</TT>", "<TT>3</TT>" 
  respectively. There is one database file
  for each star measured. Since data for each of the stars was taken
  sequentially and the images were read sequentially off tape, the user
  requests MKIMSETS to sort the extracted data by image name. Note that
  the time of observation field was undefined in the input data sets.

  2. Create the image set file from the list of IRAF images associated with
  the APPHOT databases in example 1.  The images contain the image
  header keyword "<TT>f1pos</TT>" which specifies the filter id and which may assume
  the values "<TT>1,2,3</TT>" where "<TT>1,2,3</TT>" stand for "<TT>U,B,V</TT>". 
  Since the data for the individual stars was taken sequentially the user
  requests MKIMSETS to print out value of the sidereal time stored in the
  image header keyword "<TT>ST</TT>", and to sort on that
  parameter. The image title is also printed out as an image grouping
  aid to the user. It is placed last in the fields parameter because  any
  internal blanks in the title would otherwise confuse the sorting routine.
