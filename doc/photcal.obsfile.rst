  <P>
  OBSFILE takes a list of user generated text files <I>photfiles</I>, where each
  file contains  observations of one or more objects taken through one or more
  filters, and the image set file <I>imsets</I>, and prepares a single
  observations file <I>observations</I>. OBSFILE is intended for use with any
  user digital stellar photometry program which writes its output in simple text
  files format.
  <P>
  OBSFILE performs the following functions: 1) extracts the quantities
  image name or image id, x and y position, filter id, exposure time, airmass,
  time of observation, magnitude, and magnitude error from
  <I>photfiles</I>, 2) corrects any erroneous or missing values of filter id,
  exposure time, airmass, or time of observation in <I>photfiles</I>,  3) associates each 
  field with one or more sets of images of that
  field taken through different filters 4) matches individual objects within
  a given observation by order of occurrence or x-y position, and
  5) assigns a unique name to each object in each field.
  <P>
  The parameter <I>incolumns</I> describes the format of <I>photfiles</I>.
  <I>Incolumns</I> is a list of ten numbers separated by commas or whitespace
  which specify the columns containing the following fields: the
  image name or id,
  the x coordinate, the y coordinate, the filter id, the exposure time, 
  the airmass, the time of observation the instrumental magnitude, the
  magnitude error, and the object id.
  For example
  if <I>incolumns</I> is "<TT>10 2 3 6 8 7 9 4 5 1</TT>", the object id is assumed to
  be in column 1, the image id in column 10, the x and y positions in columns 2 and 3, the filter id,
  exposure time, airmass, and time of observation in columns 6, 8, 7 and 9,
  and the instrumental
  magnitude and magnitude error in columns 4 and 5. The image names must
  match those in <I>imsets</I> or the corresponding input data is skipped.
  The columns image name, x coordinate, y coordinate, and magnitude
  are mandatory and must be present in <I>photfiles</I>. 
  Other missing columns in the data may be represented by a "<TT>0</TT>" in the
  appropriate place in <I>incolumns</I>.
  For example, if there is no magnitude error
  column in <I>photfiles</I> a value of INDEF will be written in the appropriate
  column in <I>observations</I>. 
  If there is no airmass column in <I>photfiles</I> the value in
  <I>obspararms</I> if any, or the value INDEF will be written to the appropriate
  column in <I>observations</I>. 
  If there is no filter id column in <I>photfiles</I> the value in
  <I>obspararms</I> if any, or one of the values in <I>idfilters</I>
  will be written to the appropriate column in <I>observations</I>. 
  If there is no exposure time column in <I>photfiles</I> the value in
  <I>obspararms</I> if any, or a value of one will be assumed.
  If there is no time of observation time column in <I>photfiles</I> the value in
  <I>obspararms</I> if any, or a value of INDEF will be assumed.
  <P>
  The image set file <I>imsets</I> assigns a name to each field.
  For fields containing only a single standard star this name should
  match the name of the standard star in the standard star catalog.
  For fields containing more than one star, OBSFILE constructs a unique
  name for each object in the field by adding a sequence number to the 
  field name in <I>imsets</I>, which if the star is a standard star, the
  user must later edit. For example the fourth star in the field "<TT>M92</TT>"
  will be assigned the name "<TT>M92-4</TT>" in <I>observations</I>.
  If this star is a standard star and its true name is "<TT>IX-10</TT>" in the
  standard star catalog, then the user must change "<TT>M92-4</TT>" to "<TT>IX-10</TT>"
  in <I>observations</I>.
  <I>Imsets</I> also tells OBSFILE which images
  in <I>photfiles</I> are images of the same region of the sky belonging
  to the same observation.
  The format of <I>imsets</I> is described in detail below.
  If the number of observations is small the user may wish to simply type
  in <I>imsets</I> by hand. If the number of observations is large, a 
  separate task MKIMSETS is available to assist users in preparing
  <I>imsets</I>.
  <P>
  Values of the filter ids, exposure times, airmasses, and times of observation,
  which are undefined or incorrect in <I>photfiles</I>,
  can be corrected by reading values listed in the columns <I>obscolumns</I>
  in the file <I>obsparams</I>. The format of <I>obsparams</I> is described
  in detail below.
  <P>
  OBSFILE matches the objects in different images within the same observation
  either
  by order of occurrence if <I>tolerance</I> is less than or equal to 0.0,
  or by x-y position. Matching by position is done by identifying which objects
  in each of the
  images of a given field and observation set are within <I>tolerance</I>
  pixels of each other.  The user may supply an optional file of x and y
  shifts <I>shifts</I> to be added to the object positions prior to
  matching. The format of <I>shifts</I> is described in detail below.
  If the parameter <I>allfilters</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>", only objects which are matched
  in all the filters <I>idfilters</I> are output to <I>observations</I>.
  <P>
  OBSFILE permits the user to supply 
  an optional file of aperture corrections <I>apercors</I> containing
  magnitude corrections which are added to the instrumental
  magnitudes in <I>photfiles</I>.
  The format of <I>apercors</I> is described in detail below.
  <P>
  Each new observations file created by OBSFILE has an associated format
  description file listing the column names and numbers in <I>observations</I>,
  of the fields extracted from <I>photfiles</I>. This file, referenced 
  by its parent observations file name, can be used as input to the
  MKCONFIG task. The actual name of the format description file on disk is
  constructed by prepending the string "<TT>f</TT>" and appending the string "<TT>.dat</TT>"
  to <I>observations</I>.
  For example if a new observations file called "<TT>nite1</TT>" is created by
  OBSFILE, a format description file called "<TT>fnite1.dat</TT>" will also be
  created. Any pre-existing format description file of that name, which does
  not have an associated observations file, will be deleted.
  <P>
  <P>
  THE IMSETS FILE
  <P>
  The <I>imsets</I> file lists the 
  the observations of each field, assigns a name to each
  field, and informs OBSFILE which images belong to the same
  observation of that field.
  Observations are listed in <I>imsets</I>, 1 observation
  per line with the field name in column 1, a colon in column 2,
  followed by the names of the
  images of that field for that observation separated by whitespace.
  Only data for image names in <I>imsets</I> which match those in
  <I>photfiles</I> will be extracted.
  <P>
  The field name is used to generate the output object name in <I>observations</I>.
  If there is only a single measured object in the field, then the name
  of that object in <I>observations</I> will be the name of the field. If
  the single object is a standard star, the user should edit <I>imsets</I>
  so that the field name is the same as the name of the standard star in
  the standard star catalog. If a stellar field contains more than one
  measured object, OBSFILE generates names of the form "<TT>field-#</TT>" where
  "<TT>field</TT>" is the field name and "<TT>#</TT>" is a sequence number. For example the
  fourth star in the field "<TT>M92</TT>" will be assigned the name "<TT>M92-4</TT>" in
  <I>observations</I>. If the star is a standard star, the user must edit
  the object names in <I>observations</I> to match those in the standard
  star catalog.
  <P>
  Any number of observations may have the same field name. This normally occurs,
  for example, when multiple observations of a single standard star of
  standard star field are made at several airmasses.
  <P>
  If there
  are no filter ids in <I>photfiles</I> or <I>obsparams</I> then the images in
  each image set are assigned the filter ids in <I>idfilters</I> in order
  of occurrence.
  <P>
  The <I>imsets</I> file for a  set of 50 UBV frames of fifteen standard star
  fields is listed below. There is only a single bright star per field.
  The name of star field in column 1 has been edited to be identical
  to the name of the standard in the standard star catalog. Column 2 contains
  a <TT>':'</TT>. The U, B and V
  images for each field are listed in columns 3, 4 and 5 respectively.
  The missing U image for field "<TT>STD7</TT>" is represented by the name "<TT>INDEF</TT>".
  Standard stars "<TT>STD1</TT>" and "<TT>STD2</TT>" were observed twice in the same night
  at different airmasses.

  <P>
  A sample shifts file for the previous set of UBV standards
  observations is shown below. All the standards except for "<TT>STD14</TT>" are assumed
  to have no significant shifts from filter to filter. The B and V frames
  for "<TT>STD14</TT>" are shifted -10 pixels in x and -5 pixels

  1. Prepare an observations file, from a set of standard star observations
  in a file output by the user's own digital stellar photometry program,
  for input to FITPARAMS. A sample of the file illustrating the format
  is shown below.
  Since there is only one star per field, position matching is not necessary.
  The magnitudes have already been normalized to unit exposure time by the
  user's program, and the filter ids and airmasses are correct. However the
  observing time column is missing and represented by a zero in the incolumns
  parameters.

  2. Prepare an observations file from a set of program star observations
  of a crowded field in the globular cluster M92 computed by the same
  digital photometry
  program as above, for input to FITPARAMS.  The 3 input files contain UBV
  measurements of over 2000 stars in the M92 field. Since the same stars
  were not measured in all filters position matching is necessary.
