  <B>Ccdproc</B> processes CCD images to correct and calibrate for
  detector defects, readout bias, zero level bias, dark counts,
  response, iillumination, and fringing.  It also trims unwanted
  lines and columns and changes the pixel datatype.  It is efficient
  and easy to use; all one has to do is set the parameters and then
  begin processing the images.  The task takes care of most of the
  record keeping and automatically does the prerequisite processing
  of calibration images.  Beneath this simplicity there is much that
  is going on.  In this section a simple description of the usage is
  given.  The following sections present more detailed discussions
  on the different operations performed and the order and logic
  of the processing steps.  For a user's guide to the <B>ccdred</B>
  package see <B>guide</B>.  Much of the ease of use derives from using
  information in the image header.  If this information is missing
  see section 13.
  <P>
  One begins by setting the task parameters.  There are many parameters
  but they may be easily reviewed and modified using the task <B>eparam</B>.
  The input CCD images to be processed are given as an image list.
  Previously processed images are ignored and calibration images are
  recognized, provided the CCD image types are in the image header (see
  <B>instruments</B> and <B>ccdtypes</B>).  Therefore it is permissible to
  use simple image templates such as "<TT>*.imh</TT>".  The <I>ccdtype</I> parameter
  may be used to select only certain types of CCD images to process
  (see <B>ccdtypes</B>).
  <P>
  The processing operations are selected by boolean (yes/no) parameters.
  Because calibration images are recognized and processed appropriately,
  the processing operations for object images should be set.
  Any combination of operations may be specified and the operations are
  performed simultaneously.  While it is possible to do operations in
  separate steps this is much less efficient.  Two of the operation
  parameters apply only to zero level and flat field images.  These
  are used for certain types of CCDs and modes of operation.
  <P>
  The processing steps selected have related parameters which must be
  set.  These are things like image sections defining the overscan and
  trim regions and calibration images.  There are a number of parameters
  used for fitting the overscan or prescan bias section.  These are
  parameters used by the standard IRAF curve fitting package <B>icfit</B>.
  The parameters are described in more detail in the following sections.
  <P>
  In addition to the task parameters there are package parameters
  which affect <B>ccdproc</B>.  These include the instrument and subset
  files, the text and plot log files, the output pixel datatype,
  the amount of memory available for calibration image caching,
  the verbose parameter for logging to the terminal, and the backup
  prefix.  These are described in <B>ccdred</B>.
  <P>
  Calibration images are specified by task parameters and/or in the
  input image list.  If more than one calibration image is specified
  then the first one encountered is used and a warning is issued for the
  extra images.  Calibration images specified by
  task parameters take precedence over calibration images in the input list.
  These images also need not have a CCD image type parameter since the task
  parameter identifies the type of calibration image.  This method is
  best if there is only one calibration image for all images
  to be processed.  This is almost always true for zero level and dark
  count images.  If no calibration image is specified by task parameter
  then calibration images in the input image list are identified and
  used.  This requires that the images have CCD image types recognized
  by the package.  This method is useful if one may simply say "<TT>*.imh</TT>"
  as the image list to process all images or if the images are broken
  up into groups, in "<TT>@</TT>" files for example, each with their own calibration
  frames.
  <P>
  When an input image is processed the task first determines the processing
  parameters and calibration images.  If a requested operation has been
  done it is skipped and if all requested operations have been completed then
  no processing takes place.  When it determines that a calibration image
  is required it checks for the image from the task parameter and then
  for a calibration image of the proper type in the input list.
  <P>
  Having
  selected a calibration image it checks if it has been processed by
  looking for the image header flag CCDPROC.  If it is not present then
  the calibration image is processed.  When any image has been processed
  the CCDPROC flag is added.  For images processed directly by <B>ccdproc</B>
  the individual processing flags are checked even if the CCDPROC flag is
  present.  However, the automatic processing of the calibration images is
  only done if the CCDPROC flag is absent!  This is to make the task more
  efficient by not having to check every flag for every calibration image
  for every input image.  Thus, if additional processing
  steps are added after images have been partially reduced then input images
  will be processed for the new steps but calibration images will not be
  processed automatically.
  <P>
  After the calibration images have been identified, and processed if
  necessary, the images may be cached in memory.  This is done when there
  are more than two input images (it is actually less efficient to
  cache the calibration images for one or two input images) and the parameter
  <I>max_cache</I> is greater than zero.  When caching, as many calibration
  images as allowed by the specified memory are read into memory and
  kept there for all the input images.  Cached images are, therefore,
  only read once from disk which reduces the amount of disk I/O.  This
  makes a modest decrease in the execution time.  It is not dramatic
  because the actual processing is fairly CPU intensive.
  <P>
  Once the processing parameters and calibration images have been determined
  the input image is processed for all the desired operations in one step;
  i.e. there are no intermediate results or images.  This makes the task
  efficient.  If a matching list of output images is given then the processed
  image is written to the specified output image name.  If no output image
  list is given then the corrected image is output as a temporary image until
  the entire image has been processed.  When the image has been completely
  processed then the original image is deleted (or renamed using the
  specified backup prefix) and the corrected image replaces the original
  image.  Using a temporary image protects the data in the event of an abort
  or computer failure.  Keeping the original image name eliminates much of
  the record keeping and the need to generate new image names.

  Regions of bad lines and columns may be replaced by linear
  interpolation from neighboring lines and columns when the parameter
  <I>fixpix</I> is set.  This algorithm is the same as used in the
  task <B>fixpix</B>.  The bad pixels may be specified by a pixel mask,
  an image, or a text file.  For the mask or image, values of zero indicate
  good pixels and other values indicate bad pixels to be replaced.
  <P>
  The text file consists of lines with four fields, the starting and
  ending columns and the starting and ending lines.  Any number of
  regions may be specified.  Comment lines beginning with the character
  <TT>'#'</TT> may be included.  The description applies directly to the input
  image (before trimming) so different files are needed for previously
  trimmed or subsection readouts.  The data in this file is internally
  turned into the same description as a bad pixel mask with values of
  two for regions which are narrower or equal across the columns and
  a value of three for regions narrower across lines.
  <P>
  The direction of interpolation is determined from the values in the
  mask, image, or the converted text file.  A value of two interpolates
  across columns, a value of three interpolates across lines, and any
  other value interpolates across the narrowest dimension of bad pixels
  and using column interpolation if the two dimensions are equal.
  <P>
  The bad pixel description may be specified explicitly with the parameter
  <I>fixfile</I> or indirectly if the parameter has the value "<TT>image</TT>".  In the
  latter case the instrument file must contain the name of the file.

  If an overscan or prescan correction is specified (<I>overscan</I>

  the overscan region.
  <P>
  There are two types of overscan (or prescan) determinations.  One determines
  a independent overscan value for each line  and is only available for a
  <I>readaxis</I> of 1.  The other averages the overscan along the readout
  direction to make an overscan vector, fits a smoothing function to the vector,
  and then evaluate and then evaluates the smooth function at each readout
  line or column.
  <P>
  The line-by-line determination provides an mean, median, or
  mean with the minimum and maximum values excluded.  The median
  is lowest value of the middle two when the number of overscan columns
  is even rather than the mean.
  <P>
  The smoothed overscan vector determination uses the <B>icfit</B> options
  including interactive fitting.  The fitting function is generally either a
  constant (polynomial of 1 term) or a high order function which fits the
  large scale shape of the overscan vector.  Bad pixel rejection is also
  available to eliminate cosmic ray events.  The function fitting may be done
  interactively using the standard <B>icfit</B> iteractive graphical curve
  fitting tool.  Regardless of whether the fit is done interactively, the
  overscan vector and the fit may be recorded for later review in a metacode
  plot file named by the parameter <I>ccdred.plotfile</I>.  The mean value of

  After the readout bias is subtracted, as defined by the overscan or prescan
  region, there may still be a zero level bias.  This level may be two
  dimensional or one dimensional (the same for every readout line).  A
  zero level calibration is obtained by taking zero length exposures;
  generally many are taken and combined.  To apply this zero
  level calibration the parameter <I>zerocor</I> is set.  In addition if
  the zero level bias is only readout dependent then the parameter <I>readcor</I>
  is set to reduce two dimensional zero level images to one dimensional
  images.  The zero level images may be specified by the parameter <I>zero</I>
  or given in the input image list (provided the CCD image type is defined).
  <P>
  When the zero level image is needed to correct an input image it is checked
  to see if it has been processed and, if not, it is processed automatically.
  Processing of zero level images consists of bad pixel replacement,
  overscan correction, trimming, and averaging to one dimension if the

  exposure time used is the dark time which may be different than the
  actual integration or exposure time.  A dark count calibration image is
  obtained by taking a very long exposure with the shutter closed; i.e.
  an exposure with no light reaching the detector.  The dark count
  correction is selected with the parameter <I>darkcor</I> and the dark
  count calibration image is specified either with the parameter
  <I>dark</I> or as one of the input images.  The dark count image is
  automatically processed as needed.  Processing of dark count images
  consists of bad pixel replacement, overscan and zero level correction,
  and trimming.

  The relative detector pixel response is calibrated by dividing by a
  scaled flat field calibration image.  A flat field image is obtained by
  exposure to a spatially uniform source of light such as an lamp or
  twilight sky.  Flat field images may be corrected for the spectral
  signature in spectroscopic images (see <B>response</B> and
  <B>apnormalize</B>), or for iillumination effects (see <B>mkillumflat</B>
  or <B>mkskyflat</B>).  For more on flat fields and iillumination corrections
  see <B>flatfields</B>.  The flat field response is dependent on the
  wavelength of light so if different filters or spectroscopic wavelength
  coverage are used a flat field calibration for each one is required.
  The different flat fields are  automatically selected by a subset
  parameter (see <B>subsets</B>).
  <P>
  Flat field calibration is selected with the parameter <B>flatcor</B>
  and the flat field images are specified with the parameter <B>flat</B>
  or as part of the input image list.  The appropriate subset is automatically
  selected for each input image processed.  The flat field image is
  automatically processed as needed.  Processing consists of bad pixel
  replacement, overscan subtraction, zero level subtraction, dark count
  subtraction, and trimming.  Also if a scan mode is used and the
  parameter <I>scancor</I> is specified then a scan mode correction is
  applied (see below).  The processing also computes the mean of the
  flat field image which is used later to scale the flat field before
  division into the input image.  For scan mode flat fields the ramp
  part is included in computing the mean which will affect the level
  of images processed with this flat field.  Note that there is no check for
  division by zero in the interest of efficiency.  If division by zero
  does occur a fatal error will occur.  The flat field can be fixed by
  replacing small values using a task such as <B>imreplace</B> or
  during processing using the <I>minreplace</I> parameter.  Note that the
  <I>minreplace</I> parameter only applies to flat fields processed by
  <B>ccdproc</B>.

  CCD images processed through the flat field calibration may not be
  completely flat (in the absence of objects).  In particular, a blank
  sky image may still show gradients.  This residual nonflatness is called
  the iillumination pattern.  It may be introduced even if the detector is
  uniformly illuminated by the sky because the flat field lamp
  iillumination may be nonuniform.  The iillumination pattern is found from a
  blank sky, or even object image, by heavily smoothing and rejecting
  objects using sigma clipping.  The iillumination calibration image is
  divided into the data being processed to remove the iillumination
  pattern.  The iillumination pattern is a function of the subset so there
  must be an iillumination correction image for each subset to be
  processed.  The tasks <B>mkillumcor</B> and <B>mkskycor</B> are used to
  create the iillumination correction images.  For more on iillumination
  corrections see <B>flatfields</B>.
  <P>
  An alternative to treating the iillumination correction as a separate
  operation is to combine the flat field and iillumination correction
  into a corrected flat field image before processing the object
  images.  This will save some processing time but does require creating
  the flat field first rather than correcting the images at the same
  time or later.  There are two methods, removing the large scale
  shape of the flat field and combining a blank sky image iillumination
  with the flat field.  These methods are discussed further in the
  tasks which create them; <B>mkillumcor</B> and <B>mkskycor</B>.

  There may be a fringe pattern in the images due to the night sky lines.
  To remove this fringe pattern a blank sky image is heavily smoothed
  to produce an iillumination image which is then subtracted from the
  original sky image.  The residual fringe pattern is scaled to the
  exposure time of the image to be fringe corrected and then subtracted.
  Because the intensity of the night sky lines varies with time an
  additional scaling factor may be given in the image header.
  The fringe pattern is a function of the subset so there must be
  a fringe correction image for each subset to be processed.
  The task <B>mkfringecor</B> is used to create the fringe correction images.

  If a zero level correction is desired (<I>zerocor</I> parameter)
  and the parameter <I>readcor</I> is yes then a single zero level
  correction vector is applied to each readout line or column.  Use of a
  readout correction rather than a two dimensional zero level image
  depends on the nature of the detector or if the CCD is operated in
  longscan mode (see below).  The readout correction is specified by a
  one dimensional image (<I>zero</I> parameter) and the readout axis
  (<I>readaxis</I> parameter).  If the zero level image is two dimensional
  then it is automatically processed to a one dimensional image by
  averaging across the readout axis.  Note that this modifies the zero
  level calibration image.

  CCD detectors may be operated in several modes in astronomical
  applications.  The most common is as a direct imager where each pixel
  integrates one point in the sky or spectrum.  However, the design of most CCD's
  allows the sky to be scanned across the CCD while shifting the
  accumulating signal at the same rate.  <B>Ccdproc</B> provides for two
  scanning modes called "<TT>shortscan</TT>" and "<TT>longscan</TT>".  The type of scan
  mode is set with the parameter <I>scanmode</I>.
  <P>
  In "<TT>shortscan</TT>" mode the detector is scanned over a specified number of
  lines (not necessarily at sideral rates).  The lines that scroll off the
  detector during the integration are thrown away.  At the end of the
  integration the detector is read out in the same way as an unscanned
  observation.  The advantage of this mode is that the small scale, zero
  level, dark count and flat field responses are averaged in one dimension
  over the number of lines scanned.  A zero level, dark count or flat field may be
  observed in the same way in which case there is no difference in the
  processing from unscanned imaging and the parameter <I>scancor</I> may be
  no.  If it is yes, though, checking is done to insure that the calibration
  image used has the same number of scan lines as the object being
  processed.  However, one obtains an increase in the statistical accuracy of
  if they are not scanned during the observation but
  digitally scanned during the processing.  In shortscan mode with
  <I>scancor</I> set to yes, zero level, dark count and flat field images are
  digitally scanned, if needed, by the same number of scan lines as the
  object.  The number of scan lines is determined from the object image
  header using the keyword nscanrow (or it's translation).  If not found the
  object is assumed to have been scanned with the value given by the
  <I>nscan</I> parameter.  Zero, dark and flat calibration images are assumed
  to be unscanned if the header keyword is not found.
  <P>
  If a scanned zero level, dark count or flat field image is not found
  matching the object then one may be created from the unscanned calibration
  image.  The image will have the root name of the unscanned image with an
  extension of the number of scan rows; i.e. Flat1.32 is created from Flat1
  with a digital scanning of 32 lines.
  <P>
  In "<TT>longscan</TT>" mode the detector is continuously read out to produce an
  arbitrarily long strip.  Provided data which has not passed over the entire
  detector is thrown away, the zero level, dark count, and flat field
  corrections will be one dimensional.  If <I>scancor</I> is specified and the
  scan mode is "<TT>longscan</TT>" then a one dimensional zero level, dark count, and
  flat field correction will be applied.

  The tasks in the <B>ccdred</B> package are most convenient to use when
  the CCD image type, subset, and exposure time are contained in the
  image header.  The ability to redefine which header parameters contain
  this information makes it possible to use the package at many different
  observatories (see <B>instruments</B>).  However, in the absence of any
  image header information the tasks may still be used effectively.
  There are two ways to proceed.  One way is to use <B>ccdhedit</B>
  to place the information in the image header.
  <P>
  The second way is to specify the processing operations more explicitly
  than is needed when the header information is present.  The parameter
  <I>ccdtype</I> is set to "<TT></TT>" or to "<TT>none</TT>".  The calibration images are
  specified explicitly by task parameter since they cannot be recognized
  in the input list.  Only one subset at a time may be processed.
  <P>
  If dark count and fringe corrections are to be applied the exposure
  times must be added to all the images.  Alternatively, the dark count
  and fringe images may be scaled explicitly for each input image.  This
  works because the exposure times default to 1 if they are not given in
