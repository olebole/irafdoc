  A "<TT>sinc</TT>" function uses a sinc interpolator to find the maximum of the 
  peak by interpolating the points selectes.  The FWHM calculation in this
  case is computed empirically by finding the half power point according
  to the computed peak height and the <I>background</I> level.  No FWHM

  all compute the FWHM from the fitted coefficients of the function.

  <H3>Description</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  <I>Fxcor</I> performs a Fourier cross-correlation on the input list of object
  and template spectra.  Object spectra may be either one or two dimensional
  (in `echelle' or `multispec' format), and may be correlated against a one
  or two dimensional template.  If the template spectrum is only one dimensional
  but the object is two dimensional, the template is used to correlate each of
  the apertures specified by the <I>apertures</I> parameter in the object 
  spectrum.  Two dimensional templates will correlate corresponding apertures.
  <P>
  If the input spectra are not dispersion corrected (DC-FLAG parameter missing
  or less than zero), or the <I>pixcorr</I> parameter is turned on, then only 
  a pixel space correlation is done.  This is
  appropriate for a simple cross-correlation of images whether spectra or not.
  If the spectra are dispersion corrected, a log binned correlation is
  performed and various radial velocity measurements are made. At a minimum,
  a relative velocity between the object and template spectra is produced.
  If the image headers contain sufficient information for heliocentric
  velocity corrections (see help for <B>keywpars</B>), the corrections are
  computed and possibly recorded in the image header (see below for a full
  explanation of the computed velocities).  If the value of the 
  heliocentric velocity is returned as INDEF, the user may use the <TT>'v'</TT>
  keystroke to see the full results of the correlation, including errors
  which occured causing the corrections to not be done.
  <P>
  A number of operations may be performed to prepare the data for
  correlation.  If a linear wavelength dispersion is defined, the spectra are
  rebinned to a log-linear dispersion using the interpolant set by the package
  parameter <I>interp</I> (See the section on interpolation for details).  
  At this time only linear input dispersions are supported for rebinning.
  The starting and ending wavelength for
  both spectra will remain the same, but the dispersion in log space will be
  determined from the <I>rebin</I> parameter if the input disersions aren't
  equal, or from the spectrum's endpoints and number of pixels if they are
  equal.  For example, assuming <I>rebin</I> is set to "<TT>smallest</TT>", if object
  one and the template have the same input log dispersion of 0.5e-4 A/pix the
  data will not be rebinned.  Object two with a wpc of 0.4e-4 A/pix will force
  the template to be rebinned to a common wpc of 0.4e-4 A/pix.  If the third
  object on the list then has a dispersion of 0.3e-4 A/pix, the template will
  again be rebinned from the original 0.5e-4 A/pix dispersion to a new 0.3e-4
  A/pix dispersion.  If object three and the template are the same star, the
  template spectrum will suffer from interpolation errors that should be
  considered when analyzing the results.  The output .txt file will update
  every time the common dispersion is changed.  The suggested course of action
  is to bin all spectra to the same dispersion, preferably a log-linear one,
  prior to executing this package.
  <P>
  If the <I>continuum</I> flag is set to something other than 
  "<TT>none</TT>", the object and/or template data will
  be continuum subtracted using the fitting parameters found in the
  <I>continpars</I> pset on input.  The data are zeroed outside the sample
  region specified by the <I>osample</I> and <I>rsample</I> parameters, 
  the ends of each region are apodized, and the bias is then subtracted.
  If the <I>filter</I> flag is set to something other than
  "<TT>none</TT>", the data are Fourier filtered according to the parameters in 
  the <I>filtpars</I> pset prior to the correlation computation.
  <P>
  Once the correlation is computed, the maximum peak within the window
  specified by the <I>wincenter</I> and <I>window</I> parameters is found and
  fit according to the <I>width</I> or <I>height</I> and <I>peak</I> parameters.
  A small, unlabeled plot of the entire cross correlation function (hereafter
  CCF) is drawn above a larger, expanded plot centered on the peak in a window
  of size specified by the <I>window</I> parameter.  The dashed lines in the
  small plot show the limits of the expanded plot.  The bottom axis of the
  expanded plot is labeled with pixel lag and, if dispersion information is
  present, the top axis is labeled with relative velocity.  To choose a
  different peak to fit, move the cursor to the top plot of the whole ccf and
  hit the <TT>'z'</TT> keystroke at the desired peak.  The plot will be redrawn with
  the new peak now centered in the window and a fit automatically done.  The
  status line will contain a summary of the pixel shift from the fit and
  optional velocity information.  The <TT>'v'</TT> keystroke may be used to suspend
  graphics and get a more detailed description of the correlation and fit, and
  the <TT>'+'</TT> keystroke will toggle the status line output.  To view the
  antisymmetric noise component of the correlation function, simply hit the
  <TT>'a'</TT> keystroke followed by any keystroke to return to the correlation plot.
  Similarly, the <TT>'e'</TT> keystroke may be used to preview the summary plot of the
  correlation, again hitting any key to return to the correlation.  An
  overplot of the subtracted fit (residuals) may be seen with the <TT>'j'</TT>
  keystroke.
  <P>
  If the user is dissatisfied with the fit to the peak, he can mark the left
  and right side of the peak with the <TT>'g'</TT> keystroke to redo the fit, or else
  set the cursor to mark a cutoff with the <TT>'y'</TT> keystroke, and all points from
  the peak maximum to the cursor will be fit.  To fix the background of a
  Gaussian fit (i.e. change the <I>background</I> parameter graphically), type
  the <TT>'b'</TT> keystroke at the desired level, and a new fit will be done.  The <TT>'r'</TT>
  keystroke may be used at any time to redraw the plot, and the <TT>'x'</TT> keystroke
  can be used to compute a new correlation if any of the parameters relating
  to the correlation are changed (e.g. the apodize percentage).  New
  correlations are automatically computed when new images are read in, the
  data are continuum subtracted, a different region is selected for
  correlation, or Fourier filtering is done.  Certain colon commands from
  within the Fourier or Spectrum mode will also cause a new correlation to be
  computed when these modes are exited.
  <P>
  The <TT>'c'</TT> keystroke may be used to get a printout of the cursor position in both 
  lag and relative velocity.  The cursor may be positioned in either the
  unlabeled CCF plot on the top, or in the zoomed plot on the bottom.  This is
  useful for judging the FWHM calculation, or estimating the velocity of a
  peak without using the <TT>'z'</TT> keystroke to zoom and fit.  Note that because of
  the plotting implementation, the normal cursor mode keystroke <I>shift-C</I>
  should not be used as it may return erroneous results depending upon cursor
  position.  Note also that velocities printed are only approximate relative
  velocities, and the user should properly fit a peak or use the "<TT>:correction</TT>"
  command to get a true heliocentric velocity.
  <P>
  For binary star work, the user may type the <TT>'d'</TT> and/or <TT>'-'</TT> keystrokes to fit
  and then subtract up to four Gaussians to the peaks. See the discussion
  below for more deatils on the use of this feature.  If multiple peaks were
  fit, a separate entry will be made in the log file for each peak with a
  comment that it was part of a blended peak.  The metacode file will contain
  only one summary plot with each peak marked with it's heliocentric velocity
  or pixel shift.
  <P>
  To move to the next spectrum in a list (of images or apertures), simply hit
  the <TT>'n'</TT> keystroke.  Similary, the <TT>'p'</TT> keystroke will move to the previous
  spectrum.  These commands have a hitch, though.  By default, the
  next/previous commands will move first to the next template in the template
  image list.  Once the end of the template image list is reached, the next
  spectrum will be the next aperture in the list specified by <I>apertures</I>,
  resetting the template image list automatically and possibly updating the
  aperture in the template image as well.  Finally, after correlating all of
  the templates against all of the apertures, the next/previous command will
  move to the next object image, again resetting the template image and/or
  aperture list.  To override this sequence, the user may use the "<TT>:next</TT>" or
  "<TT>:previous</TT>" commands and specify one of "<TT>aperture</TT>", "<TT>object</TT>", or
  "<TT>template</TT>".  If <I>autowrite</I> is set, the results of the last fit will be
  written to the log automatically.  To write any one of the fits explicitly,
  use the <TT>'w'</TT> keystroke.
  <P>
  The <I>fxcor</I> task also contains three submodes discussed in detail below.
  Briefly, the <TT>'f'</TT> keystroke will put the user in the "<TT>fourier mode</TT>",
  where he can examine the Fourier transform of the spectra in various
  ways and change/examine the filtering parameters.  The <TT>'o'</TT> and <TT>'t'</TT>
  keystrokes let the user examine and fit the continuum for the object
  and template spectra, respectively, using the <B>icfit</B> commands.
  Upon exiting the continuum fitting the spectra are continuum subtracted 
  and a new correlation is computed.  Finally the <TT>'s'</TT> keystroke will put
  the user in "<TT>spectrum mode</TT>", in which he may graphically select the
  region to be correlated, compute an approximate shift using the cursor,
  or simply examine the two spectra in a variety of ways.  All of these
  submodes are exited with the <TT>'q'</TT> keystroke, after which the correlation
  will be redone, if necessary, and the CCF plot redrawn.
  <P>
  Colon commands may also be used to examine or change parameter values in
  any of the <I>filtpars</I>, <I>continpars</I>, or <I>keywpars</I>
  psets.  Simply type a <TT>':'</TT> followed by the parameter name and an optional
  new value.  The <I>observatory</I> parameters may only be changed outside
  the task.
  <P>
  To exit the task, type <TT>'q'</TT>.  Results will be saved
  to the logfile automatically if one was specified, otherwise the user will
  be asked if he wants to save the results, and if so, queried for a file name
  before exiting if no <I>output</I> file was defined.
  <P>
  If the <I>output</I> parameter is set, several files will be created
  depending on the value of the <I>verbose</I> parameter (see the parameter
  description for details).  These include a file with a "<TT>.gki</TT>" suffix
  containing metacode output of a summary plot, a "<TT>.txt</TT>" suffix file
  containing text output in the standard IRAF 'list' format containing either
  verbose or non-verbose output, and a third file having a "<TT>.log</TT>" suffix
  containing a verbose description of the correlation and fit, as well as any
  warning messages.  This contents of the "<TT>.log</TT>" file is identical to what is
  seen with the <TT>'v'</TT> keystroke.  If the computed relative velocity exceeds the
  package parameter <I>z_threshold</I>, the "<TT>.txt</TT>" file will contain redshift Z
  values rather than the default velocities.  Text file output may be have
  selected columns extracted using the iraf <I>fields</I> task (where string
  valued fields will have blank spaces replaced with an underscore), and
  specific metacode plots may be extracted or displayed with the iraf
  <I>gkiextract</I> and/or <I>stdgraph</I>/<I>gkimosaic</I> tasks.

  Fourier mode is entered from the main task mode via the <TT>'f'</TT> keystroke.  By 
  default, the user is presented with a split plot of the power spectra of
  the object and template spectra (object on top) and the requested filter
  overlayed. The X-axis is double-labeled with wavenumbers on the bottom of
  the screen and frequency on top.  The "<TT>:log_scale</TT>" command can be used to 
  toggle the log scaling of the Y-axis of the plot, and the "<TT>:overlay</TT>" command 
  will toggle whether or not the filter function (if specified) is overlayed 
  on the plot.  By default the entire power spectrum is displayed, but 
  the "<TT>:zoom</TT>" command may be used to specify a blowup factor for the 
  display (e.g. "<TT>:zoom 2</TT>" will display only the first half of the power 
  spectrum).  Plot scaling and content parameters are learned for the next 
  invocation of this mode.
  <P>
  The plot contents may also be changed through various keystroke commands.
  The <TT>'p'</TT> keystroke will display the power spectrum (the default) and the <TT>'f'</TT>
  keystroke will display the two FFT's.   The <TT>'b'</TT> and <TT>'g'</TT> 
  keystrokes may be used to examine the power spectra and FFT's 
  respectively <I>before</I> filtering.  The user can determine the period

  <TT>'i'</TT> keystroke, or the continuum subtracted spectra with the <TT>'n'</TT> keystroke,
  If the data have been rebinned to a log scale, they will still be plotted 
  on a linear wavelength scale for clarity.  Pixel data are plotted identically
  to how they were read.  (NOTE: For rebinned spectra, a slight slope may be
  noticed in the 'original' data because of rebinning effects.)
  In addition, a sample regions (if selected) for the correlation are marked
  on the bottom of both plots.  To select a new sample region, use the <TT>'s'</TT>
  keystroke to select the endpoints of the region.  An <TT>'s'</TT> keystroke on the
  top plot will select a sample region for the object spectrum, and an <TT>'s'</TT> on
  the bottom plot will select a template sample, using the <TT>'b'</TT> keystroke will
  select both samples simultaneously.  The regions may be selected
  explicitly by using the "<TT>:osample</TT>" and "<TT>:rsample</TT>" commands, and selected
  sample regions may be cleared entirely using the (e.g.) "<TT>:osample *</TT>" command,
  or individual regions may be unselected by putting the cursor within the
  region and typing <TT>'u'</TT>.  See the
  parameter description for syntax of the sample ranges.  Regions will be
  checked and possibly truncated to see if they 
  lie within the range of the spectrum.  The <TT>'d'</TT>
  keystroke may be used to print the difference in pixels (and/or velocity)
  between two points on the spectrum.  This is useful for getting an
  approximate shift.  Fourier mode may be entered via the <TT>'f'</TT> keystroke.  To
  return to the correlation simply type <TT>'q'</TT> or <TT>'x'</TT>.

  In addition to the above commands, the user may examine or change the

  <H3>Interpolation</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'INTERPOLATION'>
  <UL>
  The interpolation type is set by the package parameter <I>interp</I>.
  The available interpolation types are:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	nearest - nearest neighbor
  	 linear - linear
  	  poly3 - 3rd order polynomial
  	  poly5 - 5th order polynomial
  	spline3 - cubic spline
  	   sinc - sinc function
  </PRE>
  <P>
  The default interpolation type is a 5th order polynomial (poly5).
  <P>
  The choice of interpolation type depends on the type of data, smooth
  verses strong, sharp, undersampled features, and the requirements of
  the user.  The "<TT>nearest</TT>" and "<TT>linear</TT>" interpolation are somewhat
  crude and simple but they avoid "<TT>ringing</TT>" near sharp features.  The
  polynomial interpolations are smoother but have noticible ringing
  near sharp features.  They are, unlike the sinc function described
  below, localized.
  <P>
  In V2.10 a "<TT>sinc</TT>" interpolation option is available.  This function
  has advantages and disadvantages.  It is important to realize that
  there are disadvantages!  Sinc interpolation approximates applying a phase
  shift to the fourier transform of the spectrum.  Thus, repeated
  interpolations do not accumulate errors (or nearly so) and, in particular,
  a forward and reverse interpolation will recover the original spectrum
  much more closely than other interpolation types.  However, for
  undersampled, strong features, such as cosmic rays or narrow emission or
  absorption lines, the ringing can be more severe than the polynomial
  interpolations.  The ringing is especially a concern because it extends
  a long way from the feature causing the ringing; 30 pixels with the
  truncated algorithm used.  Note that it is not the truncation of the
  interpolation function which is at fault!
  <P>
  Because of the problems seen with sinc interpolation it should be used with
  care.  Specifically, if there are no undersampled, narrow features it is a
  good choice but when there are such features the contamination of the
  spectrum by ringing is much more severe than with other interpolation
  types.

  <H3>Deblending</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DEBLENDING'>
  <UL>
  When entering the deblending function, two cursor settings define the
  local background, which may be sloping, and the region to be fit.  Note
  that both the x and y of the cursor position are used.  The lines to be
  fit are then entered either with the cursor (<TT>'m'</TT>), or by typing the
  shifts (<TT>'t'</TT>).  The latter is useful if the shifts of the
  lines are known accurately and if fits restricting the absolute or
  relative positions of the lines will be used (i.e. <TT>'a'</TT>, <TT>'b'</TT>, <TT>'d'</TT>,
  <TT>'e'</TT>).  A maximum of four lines may be fit.  If fewer lines are desired,
  exit the marking step with <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  There are six types of fits which may be selected.  This covers all
  combinations of fixing the absolute positions, the relative positions,
  the sigmas to be the same, and letting all parameters be determined.
  In all cases the peak intensities are also determined for each line.
  The options are given below with the appropriate key and mnemonic.
  <P>
  <PRE>
      a=0p1s	Fit intensities and one sigma with positions fixed
      b=1p1s	Fit intensities, one position, and one sigma with
  			separations fixed
      c=np1s	Fit intensities, positions, and one sigma
      d=0pns	Fit intensities and sigmas with positions fixed
      e=1pns	Fit intensities, one position, and sigmas with
  			separations fixed
      f=npns	Fit intensities, positions, and sigmas
  </PRE>
  <P>
  This list may also be printed with the <TT>'?'</TT> key when in the deblending
  function.
  <P>
  As noted above, sometimes the absolute or relative shifts of the
  lines are known a priori and this information may be entered by typing
  the shifts explicitly using the <TT>'t'</TT> option during marking.  In
  this case, one should not use the <TT>'c'</TT> or <TT>'f'</TT> fitting options since they
  will adjust the line positions to improve the fit.  Options <TT>'a'</TT> and <TT>'d'</TT>
  will not change the lines positions and fit for one or more sigmas.
  Options <TT>'b'</TT> and <TT>'e'</TT> will maintain the relative positions of the lines
  but allow an other than expected shift.
  <P>
  After the fit, the modeled lines are overplotted.  The line center,
  flux, equivalent width, and full width half maximum are printed on the
  status line for the first line.  The values for the other lines and
  the RMS of the fit may be examined by scrolling the status line
  using the <TT>'+'</TT>, <TT>'-'</TT>, and <TT>'r'</TT> keys.  Velocity information is obtained by
  typing the <TT>'v'</TT> keystroke.  To continue enter <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  The fitting may be repeated with different options until exiting with <TT>'q'</TT>.
  <P>
  The fitted model may be subtracted from the data (after exiting the
  deblending function) using the <TT>'-'</TT> (minus)
  keystroke to delimit the region for which the subtraction is to
  be performed. This allows you to fit a portion of a peak which may
  be contaminated by a blend and then subtract away the entire peak
  to examine the remaining components.
  <P>
  The fitting uses an interactive algorithm based on the Levenberg-Marquardt
  method.  The iterations attempt to improve the fit by varying the parameters
  along the gradient of improvement in the chi square.  This method requires
  that the initial values for the parameters be close enough that the
  gradient leads to the correct solution rather than an incorrect local
  minimum in the chi square.  The initial values are determined as follows:
  <P>
  <PRE>
      1.  The initial line centers are those specified by the user
  	either by marking with the cursor or entering the shifts.
      2.  The initial peak intensities are the data values at the
  	given line centers with the marked continuum subtracted.
      3.  The initial sigmas are obtained by dividing the width of
  	the marked fitting region by the number of lines and then
  	dividing this width by 4.
  </PRE>
  <P>
  Note that each time a new fitting options is specified the initial parameters
  are reset.  Thus the results do not depend on the history of previous fits.
  However, within each option an iteration of parameters is performed as
  described next.
  <P>
  The iteration is more likely to fail if one initially attempts to fit too
  many parameters simultaneously.  A constrained approach to the solution
  is obtained by iterating starting with a few parameters and then adding
  more parameters as the solution approaches the true chi square minimum.
  This is done by using the solutions from the more constrained options
  as the starting point for the less constrained options.  In particular,
  the following iterative constraints are used during each option:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	a: 0p1s
  	b: 0p1s, 1p1s
  	c: 0p1s, 1p1s, np1s
  	d: 0p1s, 0pns
  	e: 0p1s, 1p1s, 1pns
  	f: 0p1s, 1p1s, np1s, npns
  </PRE>
  <P>
  For example, the most general fit, <TT>'f'</TT>, first fits for only a single sigma
  and the peak intensities, then allows the lines to shift but keeping the
  relative separations fixed. Next, the positions are allowed to vary
  independently but still using a single sigma, and then allows all parameters
  to vary.
  <P>
  To conclude, here are some general comments.  The most restrictive <TT>'a'</TT>
  key will give odd results if the initial positions are not close to the
  true centers.  The most general <TT>'f'</TT> can also lead to incorrect results
  by using unphysically different sigmas to make one line very narrow and
  another very broad in an attempt to fit very blended lines.  The
  algorithm works well when the lines are not severely blended and the
  shapes of the lines are close to Gaussian.

  Determining the center of the cross correlation peak is the key step in
  measuring a relative shift or velocity between the object and template.
  The width of the correlation peak is also of interest for measuring
  a line broadening between the two samples.  Since people have different
  preferences and prejudices about these important measurements, a variety
  of methods with a range of parameters is provided.
  <P>
  In all cases, one must specify the fitting function and a sample width; i.e.
  the range of points about the correlation peak to be used in the
  measurement.  Note that the width defines where the fitting weights vanish
  and should be something like the full width.  For the CENTER1D algorithm the
  maximum weights are at the half width points while for the other methods
  (with the exception of "<TT>sinc</TT>") greater weight is given to data nearer the
  center.
  <P>
  The width may be specified in three ways.  The first is as an actual
  width in pixels.  This is the most straightforward and is independent
  of quirks in the actual shape of the peak.  The second way is to find
  where the correlation function crosses a specified height or level.
  The height may be specified in normalized correlation units or as a
  fraction of the peak height.  The former is equivalent to the
  interactive <TT>'y'</TT> key setting while the latter may be used to select some
  "<TT>flux</TT>" point.  A value of 0.5 in the latter would be approximately the
  full width at half intensity point except that the true zero or base of
  the peak is somewhat uncertain and one needs to keep in mind that the
  weights go to zero at this point.  Note that a level may be negative.
  In this method the actual width may go to zero or include the entire
  data range if the level fall above the peak or below the minimum of the
  correlation.  The minimum and maximum width parameters are applied to
  constrain the fitting region.  The last method is to interactively mark
  the fitting region with the <TT>'g'</TT> key.
  <P>
  There are five methods for determining the correlation peak position.  The
  CENTER1D algorithm has been heavily used in IRAF and is quite stable and
  reliable.  It is independent of a particular model for the shape of the peak
  or the background determination and is based on bisecting the integral.  It
  uses antisymmetric weights with maxima at points half way between the
  estimated center and the fitting region endpoint.  A parabola fit and sinc
  interpolation is also independent of background determinations.  The
  parabola is included because it is a common method of peak centering.
  <P>
  The sinc option uses a sinc interpolator together with a maximization
  (actually a minimization algorithm) function to determine the peak height
  and center.  A width will be computed only if a background level has been
  set and is determined empirically based on the peak height and background.
  Point weighting is not used in this option.
  <P>
  The gaussian and lorentzian function fits are model dependent and
  determine a center, width, and peak value.  The background may also
  be determined simultaneously but this extra degree of freedom
  for a function which is not strictly gaussian or lorentzian may
  produce results which are sensitive to details of the shape of the
  correlation function.  The widths reported are the full width at
  half maximum from the fits.
  <P>
  The parabola, gaussian, and lorentzian methods use weights which
  vary continuously from 1 at the estimated center to zero at the
  endpoints of the fitting region.  The functional form of the
  weights is a power law with specified exponent.  A value of zero
  for the exponent produces uniform weights.  However, this is
  discontinuous at the endpoints and so is very sensitive to the data
  window.  A value of one (the default) produces linearly decreasing weights.
  <P>
  All these methods produce centers which depend on the actual
  data points and weights used.  Thus, it is important to iterate
  using the last determined center as the center of the data window
  with continuous weights in order to find a self-consistent center.
  The methods are iterated until the center does not change by more
  than 0.01 pixels or a maximum of 100 iterations is reached.
  <P>
  Errors in the pixel shift are computed from the center parameter of the fitting
  function.  Velocity errors are computed based on the fitted peak height and
  the antisymmetric noise as described in the Tonry &amp; Davis paper (1979,
  <I>Astron. J.</I> <B>84,</B> 1511). Dispersion/pixel-width errors are 
  not computed in this release but are planned for a future release.
  <P>
  The initial peak fit will be the maximum of the CCF.  This will be the only 
  peak fit in non-interactive mode but a confidence level will be entered in
  the logfile.  In interactive mode, the user may select a different peak with
  the <TT>'z'</TT> keystroke, and the maximum peak within the specified <I>window</I>
  (centered on the cursor) will be fit.  The user has full control in interactive
  mode over the points used in the fit.  Once the endpoints of the peak have

  <H3>Velocity computation algorithm</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'VELOCITY COMPUTATION ALGORITHM'>
  <UL>
  Up to three velocities are computed by the task depending on the completeness
  of the images headers and the presence of dispersion information.  If only
  dispersion information is present, a relative velocity, VREL, and an error
  will be computed.  If a full header is present (see the <I>keywpars</I>
  help page), an observed and heliocentric velocity (VOBS and VHELIO
  respectively) will be computed.
  <P>
  In short form, here are the equations:
  <PRE>
  <P>
      ref_rvobs = catalogue_vel_of_template - H(temp)  # obs. vel. of temp.
      VREL = C * (10 ** (wpc * shift) - 1.)	     # relative vel.
      VOBS = ((1+ref_rvobs/C)*(10**(wpc*shift)-1)) * C # observed vel.
      VHELIO = VOBS + H(object)			     # heliocentric vel.
  <P>
  </PRE>
  where H() is the heliocentric correction for that observation.  The
  equation used for the relative velocity is derived from the standard
  (1+z), and the VOBS equation reflects that the observed velocty is the
  product of (1+z) values for the object and template (this allows for high
  redshift templates to be used).  The date, time, and position of each
  spectrum is found from the image header via the keywords defined in
  <I>keywpars</I>.  In the case of the time the task first looks for a
  keyword defining the UT mid-point of the observation
  (<I>keywpars.utmiddle</I>).   If that is not found any time present in the
  header DATE-OBS (<I>keywpars.date_obs</I>) keyword is used at the UT start
  point, if there is no time in the keyword value then the mid-point UT is
  computed from the exposure time (<I>keywpars.exptime</I>) and UT of
  observation (<I>keywpars.ut</I>) keywords.
  <P>
  The keyword added to the template header (as defined by the
  "<TT>vhelio</TT>" parameter in the <I>keywpars</I> pset) should be the catalogue velocity 
  of the template.  Since the observation of the template has a slightly
  different heliocentric correction, this is subtracted from the template
  heliocentric velocity so that the <I>observed</I> velocity of the template 
  is used when correcting the relative velocity computed from the shift.  
  This gives the <I>observed</I> velocity of the object wrt the template.  
  Adding the heliocentric correction of the object star then yields the true
  heliocentric velocity of the object.

      1. Cross correlate a list of 1-dimensional object spectra against
      three 1-dimensional template spectra, saving results automatically
      and not continuum subtracting or filtering the data:
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor.interactive = no		# Do it in batch mode
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj* temp1,temp2,temp3 autowrite+ continuum="no"
  	&gt;&gt;&gt; filter="no" output="results"
  <P>
      2. Compute a velocity for a list of apertures in a 2-dimensional 
      multispec format object image, using only two apertures of a multispec
      image as the templates:
  <P>
  	cl&gt; onedspec
  	on&gt; scopy object.ms temp apert="8,9" inform="multi" outform="oned"
  	on&gt; rv
  	rv&gt; fxcor.interactive = no		# Do it in batch mode
  	rv&gt; fxcor object.ms temp.0008,temp.0009 apertures="1-7,10,12-35"
  <P>
      In this example, apertures 8 and 9 of the object image will be used 
      as the template.  The <I>scopy</I> task is used to extract the aper-
      tures to onedspec format, into two images named "temp.0008" and 
      "temp.0009".  The task is then run with all of the apertures in the 
      aperture list correlated against the onedspec templates.
  <P>
      3. Compute a velocity by fitting a fixed number of points on the peak,
      using uniform weighting:
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj temp width=8 weights=0.
  <P>
      4. Compute a velocity by fitting a Gaussian to the points on the CCF
      peak above the 0.1 correlation level.  Constrain the number of points
      to be less than 15, and linearly decrease the weights:
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj temp func="gaussian" width=INDEF height=0.1 
  	&gt;&gt;&gt; maxwidth=15 weights=1.
  <P>
      5. Compute a velocity by fitting a Lorentzian to the peak, from the
      peak maximum to it's half power point:
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj temp func-"lorentz" width=INDEF height=0.5 peak+
  	&gt;&gt;&gt; maxwidth=15 weights=1.
  <P>
      6. Process a 1-dimensional object against a 1-dimensional template
      interactively, examining the FFT, and input spectra to define a sample
      region for the correlation:
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj temp inter+ continuum="both" autowrite- output=""
  	    Screen is cleared and CCF peak with fit displayed
  <P>
  	... to refit peak, move cursor to left side of peak and type <TT>'g'</TT>
  	... move cursor to right side of peak and hit any key
  <P>
  	    New fit is drawn and results displayed to the status line
  <P>
  	... type the <TT>'v'</TT> key for a detailed description of the correlation
  <P>
  	    Graphics are suspended and the text screen shows various
  	    parameters of the correlation and fit. 
  <P>
  	... type <TT>'q'</TT> to get back to graphics mode
  <P>
  	... to examine the FFT's of the spectra, type the <TT>'f'</TT> keystroke.
  <P>
  	    The screen is cleared and a split plot of the two power spectra
  	    after filtering is drawn with the requested filter (if any)
  	    overlayed.
  	... type the <TT>'f'</TT> keystroke
  	    The screen is cleared and the absolute value of the two FFT's
  	    after filtering is plotted, again with the filter overlayed.
  	... type ":overlay no", followed by a <TT>'g'</TT> keystroke
  	    The spectra are redrawn prior to filtering, with no filter over-
  	    lay
  	... type <TT>'q'</TT> to return to correlation mode
  <P>
  	    The screen is redrawn with the CCF plot and peak fit
  <P>
  	... type <TT>'s'</TT> to enter spectrum mode
  <P>
  	    The screen is cleared and the input spectra displayed
  	... type <TT>'s'</TT> to mark the endpoints of sample regions for correl-
  	... ation.  The user can mark either the top or bottom plot to
  	... set sample regions for the object and template respectively.
  	... Then type <TT>'q'</TT> to quit this mode
  <P>
  	    A new correlation is computed and the peak refit automatically
  <P>
  	... type <TT>'q'</TT> to quit the task, satisfied with the results
  	    The user is asked whether he wants to save results
  	... type <TT>'y'</TT> or &lt;cr&gt; to save results
  	    The user is prompted for an output file name since one wasn't
  	    specified in the parameter set
  	... type in a file name
  	 
  	    The task exits.
  <P>
      7. Save the correlation function of two galaxy spectra: 
  <P>
  	rv&gt; fxcor obj temp inter+ ccftype="text"
  	    Screen is cleared and CCF peak with fit displayed
  <P>
  	... type ":wccf" to write the CCF
  	... type in a filename for the text output
  	... quit the task
  <P>
  	rv&gt; rspectext ccf.txt ccf.fits dtype=interp
  	rv&gt; splot ccf.fits
  <P>
         The velocity per-pixel-shift is non-linear and is an approximation
         which works well for low-velocity shifts.  In the case of hi-velocity
         correlations (or when there are many points) it is best to save the
         CCF as a text file where the velocity at each shift is written to
         the file,  then use RSPECTEXT to linearize and convert to an image
         format.  This avoids the task interpolating a saved image CCF in
         cases where it may not be required.
  <P>
      7. Compute a cross-correlation where the template has already been
         corrected to the rest frame and no heliocentric correction is 
         required:
  <P>
  	  Step 1)  Use the HEDIT or HFIX tasks to add the following
  		   keywords to the template image:
  <P>
  		        DATE-OBS= '1993-03-17T04:56:38.0'
  		        RA      = '12:00:00'
  		        DEC     = '12:00:00'
  		        EPOCH   = 1993.0
  		        OBSERVAT= 'KPNO'
  		        VHELIO  = 0.0
  <P>
  		   These values produce a heliocentric correction of zero
  		   to within 5 decimal places.  The VHELIO keyword will 
  		   default to zero if not present.
  <P>
  	  Step 2)  Use the HEDIT task to add an OBSERVAT keyword to each
  		   of the object spectra.  The OBSERVATORY task can be used
  		   get a list of recognized observatories.
  <P>
  	Because mixing observatories is not currently well supported, the
  	use of the OBSERVAT keyword in <I> both</I> images is the only sure
  	way to apply the proper observatory information to each image.  Users
  	may wish to derive a zero-valued heliocentric correction for their
  	local observatory and use those values instead.
