  ADDTIONAL PARAMETERS
  The measured velocities are corrected to a heliocentric frame of reference
  if possible.  This requires determining various parameters about the
  observation.  The latitude, longitude, and altitude of the observation
  are determined from the observatory database.  The observatory is
  defined by either the OBSERVAT image header keyword or the "<TT>observatory</TT>"
  package parameter in that order.  See the help for <B>observatory</B>
  for additional information.
  <P>
  The date, universal time, right ascension, declination, and coordinate epoch
  for the observation are obtained from the image header.  The keywords
  for these parameters are defined in the <B>keywpars</B> parameter set.

  <H3>Description</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  <B>Rvreidlines</B> takes spectral lines previously identified in a reference
  image and recorded in a database and identifies them in other spectra and
  determines a radial velocity.  If the images are
  two or three dimensional or multiaperture format and a <I>step</I> greater
  than zero is specified then additional vectors
  (lines/columns/bands/apertures) in the reference image will be reidentified
  from the initial master reference vector (as defined by an image section or
  <I>section</I> parameter) provided they have not been reidentified
  previously or the <I>override</I> flag is set.  For multiple aperture
  spectra images, called multiaperture, the step size is typically 1; i.e.
  reidentify features in all spectra.  For two and three dimensional images,
  such as long slit and Fabry-Perot spectra, the step(s) should be large enough
  to minimize execution time and storage requirements but small enough to
  follow shifts in the features (see the discussion below on tracing).  The
  set of reference identifications is applied to other images in the same
  lines, columns, bands, or apertures.  In multiaperture images the same
  apertures are matched in the reference image regardless of actual line
  order; i.e.  the apertures need not be in the same order or even have all
  apertures present.
  <P>
  The reidentification of other features in other reference image vectors
  may be done in two ways selected by the parameter <I>trace</I>.  If not
  tracing, the initial reference vector is applied to the other selected
  vectors.  If tracing, the reidentifications are made with respect to the
  last set of identifications as successive steps away from the reference
  vector are made.  The tracing method is appropriate for two and three
  dimensional spatial images, such as long slit and Fabry-Perot spectra, in
  which the positions of features traced vary smoothly.  This allows
  following large displacements from the initial reference by using suitably
  small steps.  It has the disadvantage that features lost during the
  reidentifications will not propagate (unless the <I>addfeatures</I> option
  is used).  By not tracing, the original set of features is used for every
  other vector in the reference image.
  <P>
  When reidentifying other vectors in the reference image the parameter
  <B>shift</B> may be used to add a shift(s) to the features positions
  before recentering.  The shift is added to lines, columns, or bands, greater
  than the current line, column, or band and subtracted if less.  If tracing
  the shifts are the same from step to step while if not tracing the
  shifts are added to the shifts from the previous step.  Thus, in both
  cases an approximation of a slope is used.  This allows large
  slopes in the features to be followed even when not tracing but the 
  shift value must be predetermined.
  <P>
  When tracing, the parameter <I>nlost</I> is used to terminate the
  tracing whenever this number of features has been lost.  This parameter,
  in conjunction with the other centering parameters which define
  when a feature is not found, may be useful for tracing features
  which disappear before reaching the limits of the image.
  <P>
  When reidentifying features in other images, the reference
  features are those from the same aperture, line, column, or band of the
  reference image.  However, if the <I>newaps</I> parameter is set
  apertures in multiaperture spectra which are not in the reference
  image may be reidentified against the master reference aperture and
  added to the list of aperture to be reidentified in other images.
  This is useful when specta with different aperture numbers are
  stored as one dimensional images.
  <P>
  There are two centering algorithms; a flux bisecting algorithm called
  <B>center1d</B> and a gaussian fitting algorithm.  These algorithms
  are described in the help for <B>rvidlines</B>.  The algorithm used
  and whether the feature is emission or absorption is the same one used
  in the reference image.  The only caveat is that multiple gaussian
  fitting provided by the interactive <TT>'b'</TT> key in <B>rvidlines</B> is
  not done by this task and those lines will be fit by gaussians
  independently.
  <P>
  When recentering, if a feature position shifts by more than the
  amount set by the parameter <I>cradius</I> from the starting position
  (possibly after adding a shift) or the feature strength (peak to valley) is
  less than the detection <I>threshold</I> then the new feature is discarded.
  The <I>cradius</I> parameter should be set large enough to find the correct
  peak in the presence of any shifts but small enough to minimize incorrect
  identifications.  The <I>threshold</I> parameter is used to eliminate
  identifications with noise.  Failure to set this parameter properly for the
  data (say if data values are very small due to a calibration or
  normalization operation) is the most common source of problems in using
  this task.
  <P>
  In two and three dimensional images, though not multiaperture images, the
  number of lines, columns, or bands given by the parameter <I>nsum</I> are summed
  to form the one dimensional image vector in which the features are
  identified.  This increases the accuracy for reidentifying weak
  features.
  <P>
  If the parameter <I>addfeatures</I> is set additional features may be added
  after the initial reidentification and velocity determination using a line
  list of rest wavelengths.  A maximum number of added features, a matching
  distance in user coordinates, and a minimum separation from other features
  are additional parameters.  This option is similar to that available in
  <B>rvidlines</B> and is described more fully in the help for that task.
  <P>
  A statistics line is generated for each reidentified vector.  The line
  contains the name of the image being reidentified (which for two
  dimensional images includes the image section and for multiaperture
  spectra includes the aperture number), the number of features found
  relative to the number of features in the reference, the number of
  features used in the velocity determination (currently there is
  no rejection of lines) relative to the number found,  the
  mean pixel and user coordinate shfits relative to the reference
  coordinates, and the measured velocity and RMS in the velocity.
  The velocity is the heliocentric velocity if the necessary observation
  information in the image and observatory database are found.
  <P>
  If the task is run with the <I>interactive</I> flag the statistics line
  is printed to the standard output (the terminal) and a query is
  made whether to fit the lines and measure the velocity interactively.
  A response
  of yes or YES will put the user in the interactive graphical mode
  of <B>rvidlines</B>.  See the description of this task for more
  information.  The idea is that one can monitor the statistics information,
  particularly the velocity RMS, and select only those which may be
  questionable to examine interactively.  A response of no or NO will
  continue on to the next spectrum.  The capitalized responses
  turn off the query and act as permanent response for all other
  reidentifications.
  <P>
  This statistics line, including headers, is written to any specified
  log files.  The log information includes the image being
  reidentified and the reference image.
  In addition the set of lines, the observatory information used,
  and the computed observed and heliocentric velocities and redshifts
  are recorded.  This is the same information as is produced
  by <B>rvidlines</B>.

  The database specified by the parameter <I>database</I> is a directory of
  simple text files.  The text files have names beginning with 'id' followed
  by the entry name, usually the name of the image.  The database text files
  consist of a number of records.  A record begins with a line starting with the
  keyword "<TT>begin</TT>".  The rest of the line is the record identifier.  Records
  read and written by <B>rvreidlines</B> have "<TT>identify</TT>" as the first word of the
  identifier.  Following this is a name which may be specified following the
  "<TT>:read</TT>" or "<TT>:write</TT>" commands.  If no name is specified then the image name
  is used.  For 1D spectra the database entry includes the aperture number
  and so to read a solution from a aperture different than the current image
  and aperture number must be specified.  For 2D/3D images the entry name
  has the 1D image section which is what is specified to read the entry.
  The lines following the record identifier contain
  the feature information and redshift (without heliocentric correction).
  <P>
  The database files have the name "<TT>identify</TT>" and the prefix "<TT>id</TT>" because
