  The <I>mkpkg</I> utility is used to make or update IRAF packages or libraries.
  <I>Mkpkg</I> is used to bootstrap the IRAF system hence is implemented as
  a foreign task, callable either from within the IRAF environment or from the
  host system.  Usage is identical in either case (except that the details of
  when a particular argument may need to be quoted will vary depending on the
  command language used).  <I>Mkpkg</I> is upwards compatible with the old
  <I>mklib</I> utility.
  <P>
  <P>
  1. <B>Introduction</B>
  <P>
      <I>Mkpkg</I> provides two major facilities: a library update capability and
  a macro preprocessor.  The macro preprocessor provides symbol definition and
  replacement, conditional execution, and a number of builtin commands.
  The usefulness of these facilities is enhanced by the ability of <I>mkpkg</I>
  to update entire directory trees, or to enter the hierarchy of <I>mkpkg</I>
  descriptors at any level.  For example, typing "<TT>mkpkg</TT>" in the root directory
  of IRAF will make or update the entire system, whereas in the "<TT>iraf$sys</TT>"
  directory <I>mkpkg</I> will update only the system libraries, and in the
  "<TT>iraf$sys/fio</TT>" directory <I>mkpkg</I> will update only the FIO portion of the
  system library "<TT>libsys.a</TT>".
  <P>
  The <I>mkpkg</I> utility is quite simple to use to maintain small packages
  or libraries, despite the complexity of the discussion which follows.
  The reader is encouraged to study several examples of working mkpkg-files
  before reading further; examples will be found throughout the IRAF system.
  The mkpkg files for applications packages tend to be very similar to one
  another, and it is quite possible to successfully copy and modify the
  mkpkg-file from another package without studying the reference information
  given here.
  <P>
  <P>
  2. <B>Lexical Conventions</B>
  <P>
      The lexical conventions employed in <I>mkpkg</I> are those used throughout
  IRAF.  Comments may occur anywhere, begin with the character #, and extend
  to the end of the current line.  Blank lines are ignored virtually everywhere.
  Newline may be escaped with backslash to continue on the next line.
  All filenames are IRAF virtual filenames with the following extensions.
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	.a		object library
  	.c		C source
  	.e		executable (e.g., "x_package.e")
  	.f		Fortran source
  	.gc		generic C source
  	.gx		generic SPP source
  	.h		C or SPP header file
  	.inc		include file
  	.l		Lex source
  	.o		object file
  	.r		Ratfor source
  	.s		assembler source
  	.y		Yacc source
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  Since <I>mkpkg</I> is an IRAF utility it recognizes the major IRAF logical
  directories; these are summarized in the list below.  The IRAF (or UNIX)
  pathname convention is used to specify pathnames rooted in the current
  directory or a logical directory.
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	as$		where .s files go		host$as/
  	bin$		installed executables		iraf$bin/
  	dev$		device tables			iraf$dev/
  	hlib$		machdep header files		host$hlib/
  	host$		host system interface		[MACHDEP]
  	iraf$		the root directory of IRAF	[MACHDEP]
  	lib$		system library			iraf$lib/
  	math$		math sources			iraf$math/
  	pkg$		applications packages		iraf$pkg/
  	sys$		the VOS, system libraries	iraf$sys/
  	tmp$		where temporary files go	[MACHDEP]
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  All other directories should be referenced by giving the path from either the
  current directory or from one of the system logical directories shown above.
  For example, "<TT>pkg$system/</TT>" is the root directory of the SYSTEM package,
  and "<TT>..</TT>" is the directory one level up from the current directory.
  <P>
  <P>
  3. <B>Maintaining Libraries with MKPKG</B>
  <P>
      Libraries are described by a <B>member list</B> module in the "<TT>mkpkg</TT>" file.
  The syntax of a library member list module is shown below.  Note that the
  <B>mkpkg</B> module name for a library member list module is the same as the
  name of the actual library, hence must end with the extension "<TT>.a</TT>".
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	libname.a:
  		member1		dep1 dep2 ... depN
  		member2		dep1 dep2 ... depN
  		  ...
  		memberN		dep1 dep2 ... depN
  		;
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  Here, "<TT>libname.a</TT>" is the IRAF virtual filename of the library (regardless of
  what directory it resides in), "<TT>memberN</TT>" is the name of a source file which
  may contain any number of actual library object modules, and "<TT>depN</TT>" is the
  name of a file upon which the named member depends.  If any of the named
  dependency files is newer than the corresponding member source file, or if
  the member source file is newer than the compiled library object module,
  the source file is recompiled and replaced in the library.  Both source
  files and dependency files may reside in remote directories.  The names of
  dependency files in system libraries should be enclosed in &lt;&gt; delimiters,
  e.g., "<TT>&lt;fset.h&gt;</TT>".  Each member must be described on a separate line.
  <P>
  If the library being updated does not reside in the current directory
  (directory from which the "<TT>mkpkg</TT>" command was entered) then the library must
  be "<TT>checked out</TT>" of the remote directory before it can be updated, and checked
  back in when updating is complete.  These operations are performed by macro
  preprocessor directives, e.g.:
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	$checkout libsys.a lib$
  	$update   libsys.a
  	$checkin  libsys.a lib$
  	$exit
  <P>
  	libsys.a:
  		@symtab		# update libsys.a in ./symtab
  		brktime.x	&lt;time.h&gt;
  		environ.x	environ.com environ.h &lt;ctype.h&gt;\<BR>
  				&lt;fset.h&gt; &lt;knet.h&gt;
  		main.x		&lt;clset.h&gt; &lt;config.h&gt; &lt;ctype.h&gt;\<BR>
  				&lt;error.h&gt; &lt;fset.h&gt; &lt;knet.h&gt;\<BR>
  				&lt;printf.h&gt; &lt;xwhen.h&gt;
  		onentry.x	&lt;clset.h&gt; &lt;fset.h&gt; &lt;knet.h&gt;
  		spline.x	&lt;math.h&gt; &lt;math/interp.h&gt;
  		;
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  Note that the checkout operation is required only in the directory from which
  the "<TT>mkpkg</TT>" command was entered, since the library has already been checked
  out when the mkpkg-file in a subdirectory is called to update its portion
  of the library (as in the "<TT>@symtab</TT>" in the example above).  The checkout
  commands should however be included in each mkpkg-file in a hierarchy in such
  a way that the library will be automatically checked out and back in if
  <I>mkpkg</I> is run from that directory.  The checkout commands are ignored
  if the mkpkg-file is entered when updating the library from a higher level,
  because in that case <I>mkpkg</I> will search for the named entry for the
  library being updated, ignoring the remainder of the mkpkg-file.
  <P>
  Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to break the library member list up
  into separate modules within the same mkpkg-file, e.g., to temporarily
  change the value of the symbol XFLAGS when compiling certain modules.
  To do this use the "<TT>@</TT>" indirection operator in the primary module list to
  reference a named sublist, as in the example below.  Normal indirection
  cannot be used unless the sublist resides in a subdirectory or in a different
  file in the current directory, e.g., "<TT>@./mki2</TT>", since a single mkpkg-file
  cannot contain two modules with the same name.  The same restrictions apply
  to the <I>$update</I> operator.
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	libpkg.a:
  		@(i2)
  		alpha.x
  		beta.x
  		zeta.f
  		;
  	i2:
  		$set	XFLAGS = "-cO -i2"
  		gamma.f
  		delta.f
  		;
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  In the example above five object modules are to be updated in the library
  "<TT>libpkg.a</TT>".  The files listed in module "<TT>i2</TT>", if out of date, will be compiled
  with the nonstandard XFLAGS (compiler flags) specified by the <I>$set</I>
  statement shown.
  <P>
  <P>
  4. <B>The MKPKG Macro Preprocessor</B>
  <P>
      The <I>mkpkg</I> macro preprocessor provides a simple recursive symbol
  definition and replacement facility, an include file facility, conditional
  execution facilities, an OS escape facility, and a number of builtin directives.
  The names of the preprocessor directives always begin with a dollar sign;
  whitespace is not permitted between the dollar sign and the remainder of the
  name.  Several preprocessor directives may be given on one line if desired.
  Preprocessor directives are executed as they are encountered, and may appear
  anywhere, even in the member list for a library.
  <P>
  <P>
  4.1 Symbol Replacement
  <P>
      Symbol substitution in the <I>mkpkg</I> macro preprocessor is carried out
  at the character level rather than at the token level, allowing macro expansion
  within tokens, quoted strings, or OS escape commands.  Macros are recursively
  expanded but may not have arguments.
  <P>
  Macros may be defined on the <B>mkpkg</B> command line, in the argument list
  to a <B>$call</B> or <B>$update</B> directive (see below), in an include file
  referenced with the <B>$include</B> directive, or in a <B>$set</B> directive.
  All symbols are global and hence available to all lower level modules,
  but symbols are automatically discarded whenever a module exits, hence cannot
  affect higher level modules.  A local symbol may redefine a previously
  defined symbol.  The IRAF and host system environment is treated as an
  extension of the <B>mkpkg</B> symbol table, i.e., a logical directory such
  as "<TT>iraf</TT>" may be referenced like a locally defined symbol.
  <P>
  Macro replacement occurs only when explicitly indicated in the input text,
  as in the following example, which prints the pathname of the
  <B>dev$graphcap</B> file on the <B>mkpkg</B> standard output.  The sequence
  "<TT>$(</TT>" triggers macro substitution.  The value of a symbol may be obtained
  interactively from the standard input by adding a question mark after the
  left parenthesis, i.e., "<TT>$(?terminal)</TT>" (this does not work with the -f stdin
  flag).  The contents of a file may be included using the notation
  "<TT>$(@<I>file</I>)"<TT>.   Note that case is ignored in macro names; by convention,
  logical directories are normally given in lower case, and locally defined
  symbols in upper case.
  <P>
  <P>
  <PRE>
  <PRE>
  	$echo $(dev)graphcap
  	!xc $(XFLAGS) filea.x fileb.x
  </PRE>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  <P>
  Symbols are most commonly defined locally with the <B>$set</B> directive.
  The <B>$include</B> directive is useful for sharing symbols amongst different
  modules, or for isolating any machine dependent definitions in a separate
  file.  The IRAF <B>mkpkg</B> system include file <B>hlib$mkpkg.inc</B> is
  automatically included whenever <I>mkpkg</I> is run.

  </DL>

  <P>
  <P>
  The use of the <B>$set</B> directive is illustrated in the example below.
  Note the doubling of the preprocessor meta-character to avoid macro expansion
  when entering the value of the GEN macro into the symbol table.  The sequence
  "<TT>$$</TT>" is replaced by a single "<TT>$</TT>" whenever it is encountered in the input
  stream.

  Add one or more files to the special file list for the host system.  This is
  a system facility, not intended for use in applications <I>mkpkg</I> files.
  The special file list is a list of all source files needing special processing
  for the local host system.  Examples of special files are files which are
  optimized in assembler (or some other nonstandard language), or files which
  must be compiled in a special way to get around bugs in a host compiler.
  The special file list makes it possible to flag arbitrary files for special
  processing, without having to modify the standard software distribution.
  In the IRAF system, the special file list is defined in the file
  "<TT>hlib$mkpkg.sf</TT>" which is included automatically by "<TT>hlib$mkpkg.inc</TT>" whenever
  <I>mkpkg</I> is run.
  <P>
  The syntax of a <I>filelist</I> entry is as follows:
  <P>
  	modname source_file mkobj_command
  <P>
  where <I>modname</I> is the filename of a library module as it appears in a
  library module list for the named directory, <I>source_file</I> is the virtual
  pathname of the source file to be used in lieu of the standard portable
  source file <I>modname</I>, and <I>mkobj_command</I> is the <I>mkpkg</I> command
  (e.g., $xc or an OS escape) to be executed to compile the named module.
  The character "<TT>&amp;</TT>" appearing in either the source file name or mkobj command
  is replaced by <I>modname</I>.  If the <I>mkobj_command</I> is omitted the
  specified source file will be compiled with $XC using the current value of
  XFLAGS.

  5. Error Recovery
  <P>
      <B>Mkpkg</B> is implemented in such a way that it is restartable.  If a mkpkg
  operation terminates prematurely for some reason, e.g., because of a compile
  error, execution error (such as cannot find the mkpkgfile in a subdirectory),
  interrupt, etc., then the mkpkg command can be repeated after correcting
  the error, without repeating the operations already completed.  If <B>mkpkg</B>
  is interrupted it may leave checked out files, objects compiled but not yet
  updated in a library, etc. lying about, but this is harmless and the
  intermediate files will be cleaned up when the errors have been corrected
  and the run successfully completes.
