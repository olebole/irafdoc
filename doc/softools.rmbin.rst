  <DD>Verify before deleting files without extensions.  Files with well known
  extensions like "<TT>.[aoe]</TT>" are deleted without a query.  A heuristic (ZFACSS)
  is used to determine the filetype of files with unknown extensions, and
  it can fail, though in practice it works quite well.

  <DD>No execute; do not delete files.  This option may be used to generate
  a list of binary files for some purpose other than deletion.  For example,
  on a UNIX host, the following command will compute the disk space used
  by the binary files in a directory tree:
  <P>
  	% du `rmbin -n .`
  <P>
  The -n option, of course, is also useful for verifying the delete operation
  before destroying the files.

  The <I>rmbin</I> task is used to descend a directory tree, deleting (or listing)
  all the binary files therein.  The task may also be used to delete or list
  nonbinary files by explicitly listing their extensions.
  <P>
  <I>Rmbin</I> is used the strip the IRAF system down to the sources, prior to
  a full system rebuild.  After changing to the IRAF root directory, one runs
  <I>rmbin</I> to delete all the binaries in lib, sys, pkg, etc. (but <I>not</I>
  in hlib, else a bootstrap will be necessary too).  <I>Mkpkg</I> is then run
  to recompile the system; this currently takes about 20 hours on our UNIX
  11/750 development system, provided nothing else is running on the system.

  1. Delete all binaries in the pkg and sys directories of IRAF.  The example
  is for a UNIX host, but this works for all other IRAF hosts as well.
