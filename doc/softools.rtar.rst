  <DD><I>Rtar</I> uses the first filename argument as the host filename of the

  Since <I>rtar</I> is a host level program and does not read the IRAF tapecap
  file, IRAF device names such as "<TT>mta</TT>" cannot be used.

  <DD>Do not try to resolve file links by a disk to disk file copy.  By default,

  The default is to strip any blank lines at the ends of files.
  This is necessary when the file was written by <I>wtar</I> on a system
  like VMS, where the size of the file is not known before it has been
  read.  The <I>wtar</I> utility must guess at the final size and pad the

  This feature is used to relocate directories, or to read tar archives

  of the tape is extracted.  Note that if multiple entries specifying the same

  <H3>Description</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  <I>Rtar</I> reads multiple files from a UNIX <I>tar</I> format file,
  restoring the files to disk on the local host machine.
  Output filenames are mapped according to the IRAF filenaming conventions
  of the local host operating system.
  <P>
  <I>Rtar</I>'s actions are controlled by the <I>flags</I> argument. 
  <I>Flags</I> consists of a minus sign followed by a string of characters
  containing any combination of the function flags described below.
  Other arguments to <I>rtar</I> are the name of the archive file to be read,
  the name of the file on the archive at which reading is to begin,
  and the names of the files or directories to be read or to be excluded
  from the read.  In all cases, appearance of a directory name refers to
  the files and (recursively) subdirectories of that directory.
  <P>
  All <I>rtar</I> filename arguments are IRAF virtual filenames (or host
  filenames), except the prefix strings, which pertain to the tape format and
  hence are UNIX pathnames.  Magtape devices must be specified using a host
  physical or logical device name (i.e., IRAF device names like "<TT>mta</TT>" will not
  work).
  <P>
  If the input archive file is a tape the blocksize must be a multiple
  of 512 bytes, with a maximum blocksize of 10240 bytes.  Each archived file
  occupies an integral number of 512 byte blocks in the archive (this is
  required by the <I>tar</I> format).
  <P>
  Filenames appearing in the file list are interpreted as prefix strings,
  i.e., a match occurs if the given string is a prefix of an actual filename
  in the archive.  If the last character in the <I>files</I> filename is
  a <B>$</B> then an exact match is required (excluding the $ meta-character).

  <H3>Diagnostics</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DIAGNOSTICS'>
  <UL>
  A file read error occurring while reading the archive file is fatal unless
  caught and corrected by the host system.
  File header checksum errors result in skipping of the archive file
  currently being read, with execution continuing with the next archive
  file if possible.
  File write errors on the output file are reported but do not cause
  termination of <I>rtar</I>.  The output file being written will be corrupted.
  </UL>
  <! EndSection:   'DIAGNOSTICS'>
  <H3>Examples</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'EXAMPLES'>
  <UL>
  Since <I>rtar</I> is a bootstrap utility implemented as a foreign task in
  the CL, it may be called either from within the CL (as in the examples),
  or at the host system level.  The command syntax is identical on both cases.
  <P>
  1. List the contents of the disk archive file "<TT>foo.tar</TT>".
  <P>
  	cl&gt; rtar -tvf foo.tar
  <P>
  2. Unpack the tape archive on unix device /dev/nrmt8 in the current
  directory.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; rtar -xf /dev/nrmt8
  <P>
  3. Unpack the tape archive on the VMS device MSA0: in the current
  directory.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; rtar -xf msa0
  <P>
  When working within the CL, commands such as <I>rewind</I> may be used
  with <I>rtar</I>, but switching between IRAF and host device names may be
  confusing.

  <H3>Bugs</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'BUGS'>
  <UL>
  The current limit on file name length is 100 characters (this restriction
  is imposed by the standard UNIX <I>tar</I> format).
  File links are not recreated.
