  <UL>
  For each image in the input image list, the two dimensional spectra are
  extracted to one dimensional spectra by summing the pixels across the
  dispersion axis at each wavelength along the dispersion axis within a
  set of defined apertures.  The extraction apertures consist of an
  aperture number, a beam number, a title, a center, limits relative to
  the center, a curve describing shifts of the aperture center across the
  dispersion axis as a function of the wavelength, and parameters for
  background fitting and subtraction.  See <B>apextract</B> for a more
  detailed discussion of the aperture structures.
  <P>
  The extracted spectra are recorded in one, two, or three dimensional
  images depending on the <I>format</I> and <I>extras</I> parameters.  The
  output image rootnames are specified by the <I>output</I> list. If the
  list is empty or shorter than the input list the missing names are
  taken to be the same as the input image names.  Because the rootnames
  have extensions added it is common to default to the input names in
  order to preserve a naming relation between the input two dimensional
  spectra and the extracted spectra.
  <P>
  When the parameter <I>extras</I>=no only the extracted spectra are
  output.  If the format parameter <I>format</I>="<TT>onedspec</TT>" the output
  aperture extractions are one dimensional images with names formed from
  the output rootname and a numeric extension given by the aperture
  number; i.e. root.0001 for aperture 1.  Note that there will be as many
  output images as there are apertures for each input image, all with the
  same output rootname but with different aperture extensions.  The
  aperture beam number associated with each aperture is recorded in the
  output image under the keyword BEAM-NUM.  The output image name format
  and the BEAM-NUM entry in the image are chosen to be compatible with
  the <B>onedspec</B> package.
  <P>
  If the format parameter is "<TT>echelle</TT>" or "<TT>multispec</TT>" the output aperture
  extractions are put into a two dimensional image with a name formed from
  the output rootname and the extension "<TT>.ech</TT>" or "<TT>.ms</TT>".  Each line in
  the output image corresponds to one aperture.  Thus in this format
  there is one output image for each input image.  These are the preferred
  output formats for reasons of compactness and ease of handling.  These
  formats are compatible with the <B>onedspec</B>, <B>echelle</B>, and
  <B>msred</B> packages.  The relation between the line and the aperture
  numbers is given by the header parameter APNUMn where n is the line and
  the value is the aperture number and other numeric information.
  <P>
  If the <I>extras</I> parameter is set to yes then the above formats
  become three dimensional.  Each plane in the third dimension contains
  associated information for the spectra in the first plane.  If variance
  weighted extractions are done the unweighted spectra are recorded.  If
  background subtraction is done the background spectra are recorded.  If
  variance weighted extractions are done the sigma spectrum (the
  estimated sigma of each spectrum pixel based on the individual
  variances of the pixels summed) is recorded.  The order of the
  additional information is as given above.  For example, an unweighted
  extraction with background subtraction will have one additional plane
  containing the sky spectra while a variance weighted extraction with
  background subtractions will have the variance weighted spectra, the
  unweighted spectra, the background spectra, and the sigma spectra in
  consecutive planes.
  <P>
  Aperture definitions may be inherited from those of other images by
  specifying a reference image with the <B>references</B> parameter.
  Images in the reference list are matched with those in the
  input list in order.  If the reference image list is shorter than the
  number of input images, the last reference image is used for all
  remaining input images.  Thus, a single reference image may be given
  for all the input images or different reference images may be given for
  each input image.  The special reference name "<TT>last</TT>" may be used to
  select the last set apertures used in any of the <B>apextract</B> tasks.
  <P>
  If an aperture reference image is not specified or no apertures are
  found for the specified reference image, previously defined apertures
  for the input image are sought in the aperture database.  Note that
  reference apertures supersede apertures for the input image.  If no
  apertures are defined they may be created automatically, the <I>find</I>
  option, or interactively in the aperture editor, if the
  <I>interactive</I> and <I>edit</I> options are set.
  <P>
  The functions performed by the task are selected by a set of flag
  parameters.  The functions are an automatic spectrum finding and
  aperture defining algorithm (see <B>apfind</B>) which is ignored if
  apertures are already defined, automatic recentering and resizing
  algorithms (see <B>aprecenter</B> and <B>apresize</B>), an interactive
  aperture editing function (see <B>apedit</B>), a spectrum position tracing
  and trace function fit (see <B>aptrace</B>), and the main function of
  this task, one dimensional spectrum extraction.
  <P>
  Each function selection will produce a query for each input spectrum if
  the <I>interactive</I> parameter is set.  The queries are answered by
  "<TT>yes</TT>", "<TT>no</TT>", "<TT>YES</TT>", or "<TT>NO</TT>", where the upper case responses suppress
  the query for following images.  There are other queries associated
  with tracing and extracted spectrum review which first ask whether the
  operation is to be done interactively and, if yes, lead to queries for
  each aperture.  The cursor keys available during spectrum review are
  minimal, only the CURSOR MODE keys for expanding and adjusting the
  graph are available and the quit key <TT>'q'</TT>.  If the <I>interactive</I>
  parameter is not set then aperture editing, interactive trace fitting,
  and spectrum review are ignored.
  <P>
  Background sky subtraction is done during the extraction based on
  background regions and parameters defined by the default parameters or
  changed during the interactive setting of the apertures.  The background
  subtraction options are to do no background subtraction, subtract the
  average, median, or minimum of the pixels in the background regions, or to
  fit a function and subtract the function from under the extracted object
  pixels.  The background regions are specified in pixels from
  the aperture center and follow changes in center of the spectrum along the
  dispersion.  The syntax is colon separated ranges with multiple ranges
  separated by a comma or space.  The background fitting uses the <B>icfit</B>
  routines which include medians, iterative rejection of deviant points, and
  a choice of function types and orders.  Note that it is important to use a
  method which rejects cosmic rays such as using either medians over all the
  background regions (<I>background</I> = "<TT>median</TT>") or median samples during
  fitting (<I>b_naverage</I> &lt; -1).  The background subtraction algorithm and
  options are described in greater detail in <B>apsum</B> and
  <B>apbackground</B>.
  <P>
  Since the background noise is often the limiting factor for good
  extraction one may box car smooth the sky to improve the statistics in
  smooth background regions at the expense of distorting the subtraction
  near spectra features.  This is most appropriate when the sky region is
  limited due to small slit length.  The smoothing length is specified by
  the parameter <I>skybox</I>.
  <P>
  For a more extended discussion about the background determination see
  <B>apbackground</B>.
  <P>
  The aperture extractions consists of summing all the background
  subtracted pixel values at a given wavelength within the aperture
  limits.  The aperture limits form a fixed width aperture but the center
  varies smoothly to follow changes in the position of the spectrum
  across the dispersion axis.  At the ends of the aperture partial pixels
  are used.
  <P>
  The pixels in the sum may be weighted as specified by the <I>weights</I>
  parameter.  If the weights parameter is "<TT>none</TT>" and the <I>clean</I>
  parameter is no then the simple sum of the pixels (with fractional
  endpoints) is extracted.  If the weights parameter is "<TT>variance</TT>" or if
  the <B>clean</B> parameter is yes the pixels are weighted by their
  estimated variance derived from a noise model based on the <I>gain</I>
  and <I>readnoise</I> parameters and a smooth profile function.  Normally
  the profile function is determined from the data being extracted.
  However, one may substitute a "<TT>profile</TT>" image as specified by the
  <I>profiles</I> parameter for computing the profile.  This requires that
  the profile image have spectra of identical position and profile as
  the image being extracted.  For example, this would likely be the case
  with fiber spectra and an off-telescope spectrograph and a strong flat
  field or object spectrum could be used for weak spectra.  Note that
  experience has shown that even for very weak spectra there is little
  improvement with using a separate profile image but the user is free
  to experiment.
  <P>
  When the <I>clean</I> parameter is set pixels deviating by more than a
  specified number of sigma from the profile function are excluded from the
  variance weighted sum.  Note that the <I>clean</I> parameter always selects
  variance weights.  For a more complete discussion of the extraction sums,
  variance weighting, cleaning, the noise model, and profile function
  determination see <B>apvariance</B> and <B>approfiles</B>.
