  <DD>Optional output mask file identifying rejected or excluded pixels.  The
  pixel mask is the size of the output image but there is one extra dimension
  with length equal to the number of input images.  Each element of the
  highest dimension is a mask corresponding to an input image with values of
  1 for rejected or excluded pixels and values of 0 for pixels which were
  used.  The order of the masks is the order of the input images and image
  header keywords, indexed by the pixel coordinate of the highest dimension

  When specified in a file the weights must be one per line in the order of

  <DD>Section of images to use in computing image statistics for scaling and

  section with one of the modifiers "<TT>input</TT>", "<TT>output</TT>", "<TT>overlap</TT>".  The first

  <DD>The number of low and high pixels to be rejected by the "<TT>minmax</TT>" algorithm.
  These numbers are converted to fractions of the total number of input images
  so that if no rejections have taken place the specified number of pixels
  are rejected while if pixels have been rejected by masking, thresholding,
  or nonoverlap, then the fraction of the remaining pixels, truncated

  <DD>The minimum number of pixels to retain or the maximum number to reject
  when using the clipping algorithms (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip,
  avsigclip, or pclip).  When given as a positive value this is the minimum
  number to keep.  When given as a negative value the absolute value is
  the maximum number to reject.  The latter is in addition to pixels
  missing due to non-overlapping offsets, bad pixel masks, or thresholds.

  "<TT>sigclip</TT>", and "<TT>avsigclip</TT>" algorithms?  The median is a better estimator

  <DD>CCD readout noise in electrons, gain in electrons/DN, and sensitivity noise
  as a fraction.  These parameters are used with the "<TT>ccdclip</TT>" and "<TT>crreject</TT>"
  algorithms.  The values may be either numeric or an image header keyword

  <! Sec='PARAMETERS' Level=0 Label='sigscale' Line='sigscale = 0.1 (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip)'>
  <DD>This parameter determines when poisson corrections are made to the
  computation of a sigma for images with different scale factors.  If all
  relative scales are within this value of unity and all relative zero level
  offsets are within this fraction of the mean then no correction is made.
  The idea is that if the images are all similarly though not identically
  scaled, the extra computations involved in making poisson corrections for
  variations in the sigmas can be skipped.  A value of zero will apply the
  corrections except in the case of equal images and a large value can be
  used if the sigmas of pixels in the images are independent of scale and
  zero level.

  <DD>Percentile clipping algorithm parameter.  If greater than
  one in absolute value then it specifies a number of pixels above or
  below the median to use for computing the clipping sigma.  If less
  than one in absolute value then it specifies the fraction of the pixels
  above or below the median to use.  A positive value selects a point
  above the median and a negative value selects a point below the median.
  The default of -0.5 selects approximately the quartile point.

  <B>LSCOMBINE</B> combines two-dimensional longslit images by first
  resampling them to a common world coordinate system, if not already on
  the same system, and then combining the matching pixels.  The final world
  coordinate system is specified by parameters or by looking at the maximum
  ranges and minimum intervals over the input data.
  <P>
  Algorithmically it is a combination of the tasks <B>TRANSFORM</B> (using
  the WCS) and <B>IMCOMBINE</B>.  When executing it will generate temporary
  images ("<TT>lsc*</TT>") and masks ("<TT>mlsc*</TT>") if the images are not already on a

  in case of an unexpected abort leaving these files behind.
