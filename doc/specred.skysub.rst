  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  This task selects a subset of aperture spectra from a multispec
  format image, called sky spectra though they could be anything,
  and combines them into a master spectrum which is subtracted
  from another subset of spectra called the objects.  Options include
  saving the master sky spectrum and reviewing the selected sky spectra
  graphically and deleting some of them.
  <P>
  The sky apertures are selected using the aperture and beam numbers
  defined during extraction (see the <B>apextract</B> package).  In
  some applications the beam numbers are used to code object and sky
  apertures and selection by beam number is quite easy.  Otherwise one
  must list the aperture numbers explicitly.
  <P>
  The object apertures are also selected using an aperture and beam
  number list.  Spectra not selected to be objects are not modified
  by the sky subtraction.  Note that it is perfectly valid to include
  the sky spectra in the object list to produce residual sky spectra.
  <P>
  When interactively editing the sky spectra the task <B>specplot</B>
  is used.  To delete a spectrum type <TT>'d'</TT>.  To undelete the last deleted
  spectrum type <TT>'e'</TT>.  When finished type <TT>'e'</TT>.
  <P>
  The sky spectra are combined using one of combining and rejection options from
  the task <B>scombine</B> except for the option "<TT>none</TT>".
