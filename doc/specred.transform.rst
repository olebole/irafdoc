  The coordinate maps U(X,Y) and V(X,Y), created by the task <B>fitcoords</B>,
  are read from the specified database coordinate fits or from the
  world coordinate system (WCS) of the image.  X and Y are the original
  untransformed pixel coordinates and U and V are the desired output user or
  world coordinates (i.e. slit position and wavelength).  If a coordinate map
  for only one of the user coordinates is given then a one-to-one mapping
  is assumed for the other such that U=X or V=Y.  The coordinate maps are
  inverted to obtain X(U,V) and Y(U,V) on an even subsampled grid of U and
  V over the desired output image coordinates.  The X and Y at each output
  U and V used to interpolate from the input image are found by linear
  interpolation over this grid.  X(U,V) and Y(U,V) are not determined at
  every output point because this is quite slow and is not necessary since
  the coordinate surfaces are relatively slowly varying over the subsampling
  (every 10th output point).
  <P>
  The type of image interpolation is
  selected by the user.  Note that the more accurate the interpolator the
  longer the transformation time required.  The parameter <I>flux</I> selects
  between direct image interpolation and a flux conserving interpolation.
  Flux conservation consists of multiplying the interpolated pixel value by
  the Jacobean of the transformation at that point.  This is essentially
  the ratio of the pixel areas between the output and input images.  Note
  that this is not exact since it is not an integral over the output pixel.
  However, it will be very close except when the output pixel size is much
  greater than the input pixel size.  A log describing the image transformations
  may be kept or printed on the standard output.
  <P>
  The output coordinate grid may be defined by the user or allowed to
  default to an image of the same size as the input image spanning the
  full range of user coordinates in the coordinate transformation maps.
  When the coordinate maps are created by the task <B>fitcoords</B> the
  user coordinates at the corners of the image are recorded in the
  database.  By default these values are used to set the limits of the
  output grid.  If a pixel interval is not specified then an interval
  yielding the specified number of pixels is used.  The default number of
  pixels is that of the input image.  Note that if a pixel interval is
  specified then it takes precedence over the number of pixels.
  <P>
  The pixel intervals may also be logarithmic if the parameter <I>xlog</I> or
  <I>ylog</I> is "<TT>yes</TT>".  Generally, the number of output pixels is specified
  in this case .  However, if the interval is specified it must be a base
  10 logarithmic interval and not in units of the x and y limits which are
  specified in user units.
  <P>
  The transformation from the desired output pixel to the input image may
  fall outside of the input image.  In this case the output pixel may be
  set to the nearest pixel value in the input image or to a particular value
  using the <I>blank</I> parameter.  Also if an output mask is created this
  pixels will have a value of one in the mask.
  <P>
  The parameters <I>minput</I> and <I>moutput</I> provide for input and output
  pixel masks.  An input mask is not used in calculating the transformed
  pixel value but is used to identify the output pixels in the output mask
  which make a significant contribution to the interpolated value.  The
  significance is determined as follows.  The input mask values above zero
  are converted to one hundred.  The mask is then interpolated in the same
  way as the input image.  Any interpolated value of ten or greater is then
  given the value one in the output mask.  This means if all the input pixels
  had mask values of zero a result of zero means no bad pixels were used.
  If all the input pixels had values of 100 then the result will be 100 and
  the output mask will flag this as a bad pixel.  Other values are produced
  by a mixture of good and bad pixels weighted by the interpolation kernel.
  The choice of 10% is purely empirical and gives an approximate identification
  of significant affected pixels.

  Arc calibration images were used to determine a two dimensional dispersion
  map called dispmap.  Stellar spectra were used to determine a two dimensional
  distortion map call distort.  These maps where made using the task
  <B>fitcoords</B>. To transform a set of input images into linear wavelength
  between 3800 and 6400 Angstroms (the user coordinate units) with a dispersion
  of 3 Angstroms per pixel:

  surface functions (one for the dispersion axis, "<TT>henear</TT>", and one in
  spatial axis, "<TT>object</TT>") of order 6 in both dimensions created with the
  task <B>fitcoords</B>.  The times are for a UNIX/VAX 11/750.

  <DD>With Version 2.6 of IRAF the algorithm used to invert the user
  coordinate surfaces, U(X,Y) and V(X,Y) to X(U,V) and Y(U,V), has been
  changed.  Previously surfaces of comparable order to the original
  surfaces were fit to a grid of points, i.e. (U(X,Y), V(X,Y), X) and
  (U(X,Y), V(X,Y), Y), with the same surface fitting routines used in
  <B>fitcoords</B> to obtain the input user coordinate surfaces.  This
  method of inversion worked well in all cases in which reasonable
  distortions and dispersions were used.  It was selected because it was
  relatively fast.  However, it cannot be proved to work in all cases; in
  one instance in which an invalid surface was used the inversion was
  actually much poorer than expected.  Therefore a more direct iterative
  inversion algorithm is now used.  This is guaranteed to give the
  correct inversion to within a set error (0.05 of a pixel in X and Y).
  It is slightly slower than the previous algorithm but it is still not
  as major a factor as the image interpolation itself.
