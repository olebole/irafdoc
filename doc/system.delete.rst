  <DD>This is the default action to take when operating in "<TT>verify</TT>" mode.
  For example, if the default action is "<TT>yes</TT>", one need only type RETURN in
  response to the verify prompt to delete the file.

  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  <I>Delete</I> destroys a file or files and returns the space they occupied to
  the host system, to be reused for other files.  Once a file has been deleted,
  it is gone forever (unless a copy exists somewhere).  Enabling <I>verify</I>
  gives one the opportunity to say yes or no before each file is deleted; this
  is particularly useful when <I>files</I> is a template.  Note that
  <I>protect</I> can be used to protect files from deletion, accidental or
  otherwise.  Imagefiles are automatically protected by the system to remind
  the user to use <I>imdelete</I> to delete images (this is necessary because
  an image is stored in more than one physical file).

  <P>
  1. Delete all files with extension "<TT>.x</TT>", verifying each file deletion before
  it is performed.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; delete *.x ver+
  <P>
  2. List all files in the current directory, deleting only those files for
  which the user responds to the verify prompt with "<TT>yes</TT>" or "<TT>y</TT>".  Note that
  "<TT>delete *</TT>" is a very dangerous operation.
  <P>
  	cl&gt; delete * ver+ def=no
