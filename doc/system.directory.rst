  <DD>Sort the file list alphabetically.  If sorting is disabled the directory
  program lists the files in the order in which they are read from the
  directory, which may or may not be sorted.  The directory listing is produced
  line by line as files are read from the directory, rather than accumulating
  the entire file list in memory before composing the table, hence this is the
  fastest method of listing a directory, particularly if the directory is very
  large.

  The <B>directory</B> task lists or prints information describing some subset
  of the files in a directory or directories.  If no name template is given,
  "<TT>.</TT>" is assumed, i.e., all files in the current directory are listed.
  <P>
  The long format listing gives a file type string, followed by
  the name of the owner of the file, the file size, date and time at which
  the file was last modified, and lastly the file name.
  The file type string has fields noting if the file is a directory file (d),
  an executable file (x), a text or binary file (t or b), a protected file (p),
  and summarizing the file permissions (read or write, r or b) for the owner,
  the group, and the rest of the world.  A minus sign indicates that the file
  does not have that particular attribute.
  <P>
  All file names are printed in the IRAF virtual filename syntax, which is the
  same on all host machines.  IRAF filenames may be up to 32 characters in
  length, may contain any combination of alphanumeric characters, underscore,
  or period, and are case sensitive.  Some of the common filename extensions
  are listed below; these are mapped to and from the host filename extensions
  when a file is accessed, a directory is listed, or a filename template is
  expanded.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	.a	object library
  	.c	C source file
  	.cl	CL source file
  	.e	executable (runnable) file
  	.f	Fortran source file
  	.gX	generic source file (X=[cx])
  	.h	global header file
  	.hlp	help file
  	.o	object file
  	.par	CL parameter file
  	.s	assembler source file
  	.x	SPP source file
  </PRE>
  <P>
  When listing large directories, the time required to accumulate and sort the
  entire directory in memory before producing the output listing may become
  significant (i.e., more than a few seconds).  If this happens, try setting
  the <I>sort</I> option to <I>no</I>, and the directory listing should appear
  immediately.

  3. Print a single column listing of all the files with extension "<TT>.h</TT>"
  in the logical directory "<TT>lib$</TT>".

  4. While in the "<TT>system</TT>" directory, print the contents of the parallel
  directory "<TT>dataio</TT>".
  <P>

  5. Test if the file "<TT>alpha</TT>" exists in the current directory.  In the example,
  the output given indicates that the file was not found.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; dir alpha
  	no files found

  6. Print the contents of the directory USR$2:[IRAF.LOCAL] on the remote VMS
  node "<TT>draco</TT>" (requires IRAF network access to the remote node).
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	cl&gt; dir draco!usr\$2:\[iraf.local]

  There is no provision for wildcarding directories, e.g., "<TT>dir */*.x</TT>".
  The long format listing can currently only be sorted by filename (although
  the <I>sort</I> program may be used in a pipe).  The file existence test will
  not be performed if individual files are named as list elements within
  a filename template.
