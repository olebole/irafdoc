  Despite the complex appearing hidden parameters, <B>help</B> is easy to use
  for simple tasks.  <B>Help</B> is most commonly used to get help on the current
  package, and to get help on a program named in a CL menu.  To get help on
  the current package one need only type <B>help</B> without any arguments.
  For example, if the current package is <B>plot</B>, the command and its output
  might appear as follows:
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	pl&gt; help
  		contour - Make a contour plot of an image
  		  graph - Graph one or more image sections or lists
  		   pcol - Plot a column of an image
  		  pcols - Plot the average of a range of image columns
  		   prow - Plot a line (row) of an image
  		  prows - Plot the average of a range of image lines
  		surface - Make a surface plot of an image
  	pl&gt;
  </PRE>
  <P>
  To get help on a module one supplies the module name as an argument,
  <P>
  	pl&gt; help graph
  <P>
  and the manual page for the <B>plot.graph</B> program will be printed on the
  terminal.  To get a hardcopy of the manual page on the printer, the output
  may be redirected to the line printer, as follows:
  <P>
  	pl&gt; help graph | lprint

  <H3>Description</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  The function of the <B>help</B> program is to perform a depth first search
  of the help database <I>helpdb</I>, printing help for all packages and modules
  matching the template.  By default the standard IRAF help database is searched,
  but any other help database may be searched if desired.  A help database is
  precompiled with the <B>mkhelpdb</B> program to speed up runtime searches for
  help modules.  The standard IRAF help database contains the documentation and
  source for all CL programs and system and math library procedures installed
  in IRAF.
  <P>
  A help template is a string type parameter to the CL.  The form of a template
  is a list of patterns delimited by commas, i.e.,
  <P>
  	"<TT>pattern1, pattern2, ..., patternN</TT>"
  <P>
  The form of a pattern is
  <P>
  	package_pattern.module_pattern
  <P>
  If the "<TT>.</TT>" is omitted <I>module_pattern</I> is assumed.  The standard pattern
  matching meta-characters, i.e., "<TT>*?[]</TT>", are permitted in patterns.
  Simple patterns are assumed to be abbreviations.

  <P>
  The GUI component of the task is a front-end to the IRAF 
  <A HREF="system.help"><B>help</B></A>
  task which provides on-the-fly conversion of help documents to HTML for
  presentation in the GUI or formatted PostScript for hardcopy.  
  The GUI is started by setting the 
  <A HREF="#l_device"><I>device</I></A>
  parameter to the special value <I>gui</I>, it is only available when using
  an XGterm window to start IRAF and assuming the <I>stdgraph</I> environment
  variable is set to xgterm.
  <P>
  Help pages may be loaded on the command line, through use of a
  file browser, or by navigating the help databases using a familiar CL
  package menu scheme.   It also features a search capability similar to the 
  <A HREF="system.references"><B>references</B></A>
  task and a complete history mechanism. 
  <P>
  When invoked with no command line arguments the task starts as a browser
  and the user is presented with a GUI that has the toplevel CL package menu
  in the upper navigation window.  The main display window below will contain
  any help page specified in the 
  <A HREF="#l_template">template</A>
  parameter or loaded on
  the command line by specifying the 
  <A HREF="#l_template">template</A>
  and 
  <A HREF="#l_file_template">file_template</A>
  parameters. If the 
  <A HREF="#l_search">search</A>
  parameter is enabled the 
  <A HREF="#l_template">template</A>
  is taken to be a search phrase and the database is searched for tasks
  matching the keyword and the GUI will appear with the search panel mapped
  so the user can select the task help to
  view.  When no 
  <A HREF="#l_template">template</A>
  is given the main display window will start with the page specified by the 
  <A HREF="#l_home">home</A>
  parameter, this can be a user-defined HTML file giving links to specific tasks
  (see below for details) or if 
  <A HREF="#l_home">home</A>
  is empty the display will contain the online help for the task.
  <P>
  The first time the task is run, or whenever the help database is updated,
  a quick reference file (specified by the task 
  <A HREF="#l_quickref">quickref </A>
  parameter) and package menu file will be created in the user's <I>uparm</I>
  directory to speed up help searching and subsequent startups of the task.

  When run as a GUI browser <I>HELP</I> works very much like any WWW browser.
  The top panel is a list widget that will always contain a CL package listing,
  at startup this will be the toplevel <I>"Home"</I> package menu one would see
  when first logging into the CL containing the core system packages, NOAO
  package, and any site-specific external package, or in the case of starting
  with a specific task it will be the parent package for the task.  Additionally,
  system documents for the 
  <A HREF="os"><B>os</B></A>
  HSI routines and the 
  <A HREF="sys.imfort"><B>imfort</B></A>
  and
  <A HREF="math"><B>math</B></A>
  interfaces will be available in the <I>Home</I> package although
  these are programmatic interfaces and not tasks which can be executed.
  <P>
  New packages or task help pages are loaded by selecting an item from the 
  package menu list using the left mouse button.  If the requested item is a 
  package, the menu listing will change as though the package were loaded in
  the CL, and the help display panel will contain a listing of the package
  tasks with a one-line description for each task such as would be seen with 
  a <I>"help &lt;package&gt;"</I> command using the standard task.  New items may then
  be selected using either the menu list or links in the display panel.  If the
  item is a task, the help page for the task will appear in the display panel.
  In either case new pages may be selected from the menu listing.  
  <P>
  Specific help documents may also be requested by entering the task/package
  name in the <B>Topic</B> text widget above the menu list.  As when selecting
  from the package menu list, items selected this way will cause the menu
  list to change to the package menu for the parent package if the item is a
  task (displaying the help page in the display panel) or the package menu
  if the item is a package (displaying the one-liner package listing in the
  display panel).
  <P>
  Using the <B>Back</B> button will revert to the previous page in the history
  list which will either be the previously loaded package or help page.
  Similarly, selecting the <B>Forward</B> button will move the next page further
  down in the history list, either button will become insensitive when the 
  end of the list on either end is reached.  Selecting the <B>Up</B> button will
  cause the browser to immediately jump up the previous package, skipping 
  over any help pages that were loaded in between.  The <B>Home</B> button will
  cause the default homepage (either the user-defined page if specified by the
  task <I>home</I> parameter or the online help) to be displayed.  Browsing
  in this way can also be done using the navigation menu created by hitting
  the right mouse button while in the main display panel.
  <P>
  Users can also jump to specific pages in the history list using the
  <B>History</B> button on the main menubar.   The right column of the menu
  will indicate whether the item is a task, package, internal link or a text
  file.  The history list is truncated at about 40 entries in the menu but
  the user may work back incrementally by selecting the last item of the 
  menu, after which the History button will display the previous 40 entries.
  The history list may be cleared except for the current page by selecting
  the <I>Clear History</I> menu item.

  Once a help page is loaded the middle menubar above the display panel
  will change to activate widgets based on the position within the history
  list and options available for a particular page.  The left-most group
  of buttons are the standard navigation buttons described above.
  The middle group of buttons contains the <B>Sections</B> and
  <B>Parameters</B> buttons which are used to browse within a help document.
  The <I>Sections</I> button is a menu listing all of the sections found
  within a help page, allowing the user to jump to a specific section
  rather than scrolling through the entire document. The <I>Sections</I>
  menu is also available using the middle mouse button from the
  main display area.  The <I>Parameters</I> button is similarly a menu
  listing of all task parameter help sections found within the document.
  Both or either of these buttons will become insensitive when no section
  or parameter information is found in the document.
  <P>
  The right-most group of buttons represent the various help options available
  for each page.  The default is to get the task help, however help pages
  may have an associated <B>source</B> file or <B>sysdoc</B> (e.g. if the task is
  a CL script there may be a pointer to the script source itself, or a package
  may have a general overview document listed as the system document).  Once
  a help page is loaded these buttons will change become sensitive if that option
  is available, simply select the button to view the option.  Selecting the
  <B>Files</B> button will bring up a panel listing all the files associated
  with a particular help topic.  When a help topic is selected and an option is
  defined but the file does not exist, the options button will display a yellow
  diamond icon even if the button is insensitive, a green icon indicates the
  currently selected option.  This feature may be disabled by selecting the

  one or more keywords into the <B>Topic</B> field at the bottom of the panel
  and initiate the search with either a carriage return or hitting the
  <I>Search</I> button just beside it.  The panel will then show a list of all
  tasks and packages which match the search phrase along with a one-line
  description of the task.  Help pages may be displayed by selecting either the
  task or package link with the left mouse button, in both case the package
  menu list on the main help window will be updated to list the package
  contents allowing other tasks from that package to be selected in the normal
  way.
  <P>
  By default the exact phrase entered in the topic window will be used for the
  search.  This can be relaxed by toggling the  "<TT>Require exact match</TT>" button
  at the top of the panel.  For example,  to search for all tasks matching
  <I>either</I> the keyword "<TT>flat</TT>" or "<TT>field</TT>" turn off the exact match
  toggle and the search will return not only tasks matching "<TT>flat field</TT>" but 
  also any task description containing only one of the words such as the
  VELVECT task which plots velocity <I>field</I>s.
  <P>
  Within a help document itself one can search for a string by selecting
  the <B>Find</B> button from the main menubar to bring up a panel used to
  enter the search string.  When the text is entered the main display 
  window will reposition itself and highlight the text found within the
  document.  Searches can be repeated and will wrap around the document
  automatically, searches can be done either forward or backward through
  the text and may be case insensitive.

  Help pages may be output to any configured IRAF printer by selecting the
  main menubar <B>Print</B> button to bring up the print panel.  Task help pages
  will be converted to formatted PostScript and may be sent to either a
  printer or saved to disk depending on the selection made in the printer 
  panel.  If the printer name is set to the special value <I>"printer"</I> then
  the device named by the CL <I>printer</I> environment variable will be used.
  When saving to disk files the default action is to save to a filename whose
  name is the task name plus a "<TT>.ps</TT>" extension.  Either of these are changeable
  within the GUI as is the default page size to be used when generating the
  PostScript.
  <P>
  The main menubar <B>File</B> button can also be used to bring up the file
  browser in order to save the current document to disk.  Help pages may be
  saved as either the origin LROFF source for the file, formatted text as you
  would get from the standard help task, HTML as is displayed in the GUI, or
  formatted PostScript.  The choice of formats is dictated by the type of file
  being displayed (e.g. you cannot save PostScript of a program source).

  <H3>Lroff directive extensions for html</H3>
  <! BeginSection: 'LROFF DIRECTIVE EXTENSIONS FOR HTML'>
  <UL>
  To better support HTML links within documents and to other help pages two
  new directives have been added to the LROFF text formatter.  These are
  <B>.hr</B> to specify a link (an HTML <I>HREF</I> directive) and <B>.hn</B>
  to specify a name (an HTML <I>NAME</I> directive).  The syntax for these are
  as follows:
  <PRE>
  <P>
  	<B>.hn</B><I> &lt;name&gt;</I>
  	<B>.hr</B><I> &lt;link&gt; &lt;text&gt; </I>
  </PRE>
  <P>
  where <I>&lt;name&gt;</I> is the destination name of an internal link, <I>&lt;link&gt;</I>
  is the URL of the link to be created, and <I>&lt;text&gt;</I> is the text to be
  displayed in the HTML.  The URL syntax is either a <TT>'#'</TT> character followed
  by a destination name, a simple <I>task</I> name or <I>package</I> name,
  or a <I>package.task</I> pair giving a more precise task.  For internal links
  the current document is repositioned so the name is at the top of the display,
  for task help links new help pages will be loaded in the browser.  
  <P>
  These directives are ignored when converting the LROFF to either formatted
  plain text or PostScript.

  On some systems, typing the next command keystroke before the end-of-page
  prompt is printed may result in the character being echoed (messing up the
