  The listed files are searched for the given pattern, copying each line that
  matches to the standard output.  If "<TT>stop</TT>" is set the action is reversed,
  i.e., all lines are passed on to the output except those which match the
  pattern.  If no files are named text is read from the standard input.
  The pattern matching meta-characters are described in the table below.
  <P>
  <PRE>
  	^		matches the beginning of a line
  	$		matches the end of a line
  	?		matches any single character
  	*		matches zero or more of whatever is at the left
  	[12345]		matches any single character in the given set
  	[1-5]		matches any single character in a range
  	[^a-z]		matches any character NOT in the range/set
  	#		matches whitespace
  	{chars}		turns off case sensitivity inside the braces
  	\		used to include a meta-character in the pattern
  </PRE>
  <P>
  If more than one file is being searched, each output line is prefixed
  with its file name.
