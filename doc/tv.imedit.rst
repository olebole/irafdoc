  <! BeginSection: 'DESCRIPTION'>
  <UL>
  Regions of images are examined and edited.  This may be done interactively
  using an image display and cursor or non-interactively using a list of
  positions and commands.  There are a variety of display and editing
  options.  A list of input images and a matching list of output images
  are specified.  The output images are only created if the input image
  is modified (except by an explicit "<TT>write</TT>" command).  If no output
  list is specified (an empty list given by "<TT></TT>") then the modified images
  are written back to the input images.  The images are edited in
  a temporary buffer image beginning with "<TT>imedit</TT>".
   
  Commands are given via a cursor list.  When the task is run
  interactively this will normally be the standard image cursor
  (stdimcur).  Commands may be read from a file.  The file format may be
  cursor values including the command keys, a simple list of positions
  with the default command given by the <I>default</I> parameter, and a
  regions file, as used in the task <B>fixpix</B> and the <B>ccdred</B>
  package, selected by the <I>fixpix</I> parameter.
   
  The commands which modify the image may be written to a log file specified
  by parameter <I>logfile</I>.  This file can be used as a record of the
  pixels modified.  The format of this file is also suitable for input
  as a cursor list.  This allows the same commands to be applied to other
  images.  <I>Be careful not to have the cursor input and logfile have the
  same name!</I>
   
  When the <I>display</I> parameter is set the command given by the parameter
  <I>command</I> is executed.  Normally this command loads the image display
  though it could also create a contour map or other graph whose x and y
  coordinates are the same as the image coordinates.  The image is displayed
  when editing interactively and the standard image cursor (which can
  be redefined to be the standard graphics cursor) is used to select
  regions to be edited.  When not editing interactively the display
  flag should be turned off.
   
  It is nice to see changes to the image displayed immediately.  This is
  possible using the <I>autodisplay</I> option.  Note that this requires
  the display parameter to also be set.  If the autodisplay flag is set
  the display command is repeated after each change to the image.  The
  drawback to this is that the full image (or image section) is reloaded
  and so can be slow.  If not set it is still possible to explicitly give
  a redisplay command, <TT>'r'</TT>, after a number of changes have been made.
   
  Another display option is to make surface graphs to the specified
  graphics device (normally the standard graphics terminal).  This may
  be done by the commands <TT>'g'</TT> and <TT>'s'</TT> and automatically after each
  change if the <I>autosurface</I> parameter is set.  The two types of
  surface plots are a single surface of the image at the marked position
  and before and after plots for a change.
   
  Regions of the image to be examined or edited are selected by one
  or two cursor commands.  The single cursor commands define the center
  of an aperture.  The shape of the aperture, circular or square, is
  specified by the <I>aperture</I> parameter and the radius (or half
  the edge of a square) is specified by the <I>radius</I> parameter.
  The radius may be zero to select a single pixel.  The keys <TT>'+'</TT> and
  <TT>'-'</TT> may be used to quickly increment or decrement the current radius.
  The two keystroke commands either define the corners of a rectangular
  region or the endpoints of a line.
   
  Because it is sometimes difficult to mark cursor position precisely
  the defined region may be shifted so that the center is either
  a local maximum or minimum.  This is usually desired for editing
  cosmicrays, bad pixels, and stars.  The center pixel of the aperture
  is moved within a specified search radius given by parameter
  <I>search</I>.  If the search radius is zero then the region defined
  by the cursor is not adjusted.  The sign of the search radius
  selects whether a maximum (positive value) or a minimum (negative value)
  is sought.  The special key <TT>'t'</TT> toggles between the two modes
  in order to quickly edit both low sensitivity bad pixels and
  cosmicrays and stars.
   
  Once a region has been defined a background region may be required
  to estimate the background for replacement.  The background
  region is an annulus of the same shape separated by a buffer width,
  given by the parameter <I>buffer</I>, and having a width given by
  the parameter <I>width</I>.
   
  The replacement options are described below as is a summary of all the
  commands.  Two commands requiring a little more description are the
  space and <TT>'p'</TT> commands.  These print the statistics at the cursor
  position for the current aperture and background parameters.  The
  printout gives the x and y position of the aperture center (after the
  search if any), the pixel value (z) at that pixel, the mean background
  subtracted flux in the aperture, the number of pixels in the aperture,
  the mean background "<TT>sky</TT>", the sigma of the background residuals from
  the background fit, and the number of pixels in the background region.
  The <TT>'p'</TT> key additionally prints the pixel values in the aperture.
  Beware of apertures with radii greater than 5 since they will wrap
  around in an 80 column terminal.
   
  When done editing or examining an image exit with <TT>'q'</TT> or <TT>'Q'</TT>.  The
  former saves the modified image in the output image (which might be
  the same as the input image) while the latter does not save the
  modified image.  Note that if the image has not been modified then
  no output occurs.  After exiting the next image in the input
  list is edited.  One may also change input images using the
  "<TT>:input</TT>" command.  Note that this command sets the output to be the
  same as the input and a subsequent "<TT>:output</TT>" command should be
  used to define a different output image name.  A final useful
  colon command is "<TT>:write</TT>" which forces the current editor buffer
  to be written.  This can be used to save partial changes.

  parameters.  The median is used or the surface is evaluated for the pixels
  in the replacement region.  If a positive sigma is specified then gaussian
  noise is added.  If a sigma of INDEF is specified then the residuals of the
  background pixels are sorted, the upper and lower 10% are excluded, and the

  pixel at each line or column on either side of the replacement region
  is used for interpolation.  Gaussian noise may be added but background
  sampling is not available.  This method is similar to the method used

  <DD>This task is a first version of what will be an evolving task.
  Additional features and options will be added as they are suggested.
  It is also a prototype using a very limited display interface; execution
  of a separate display command.  Much better interaction with a variety
  of image displays will be provided after a planned "<TT>image display
  interface</TT>" is implemented.  Therefore any deficiencies in this area
  should be excused.
   
  The zoom and roam features provided here are quite useful.  However,
  they depend on a feature of the tv.display program which fills the
  current image display window by pixel replication or interpolation.
  If this is left out of the display command these features will not
  work.  The trick is that this task displays sections of the editor
  buffer whose size and position is based on an internal zoom and
  center and the display program expands the section to fill the
  display.
   
  The surface plotting is done using an imported package.  The limitations
  of this package (actually limitations in the complexity of interfacing
  the application to this sophisticated package) mean that the
  surface plots are always scaled to the range of the data and that
  it is not possible to label the graph or use the graphics cursor to
  point at features for the task.
