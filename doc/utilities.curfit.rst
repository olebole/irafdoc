  A curve is fit to data read from either an image section or a list.
  The type of curve is set by the <B>function</B> parameter as either
  a legendre polynomial, chebyshev polynomial, linear spline or cubic
  spline, with the order of the fit (or number of spline pieces) set by
  <B>order</B>.  If data is read from an image, the <B>axis</B> parameter
  is used to reduce the dimensionality of the image; it specifies the
  axis along which the image is projected.  For example, when <B>axis</B>
  = 1, the image is compressed to a column.  <B>Axis</B> = 2 would project
  the image along a line; <B>axis</B> = 3 indicates projection in the z
  direction, etc.
  <P>
  The input data must be ordered in x because of a restriction in the
  interactive plotting package.  If the input is from a list, the data
  are sorted prior to fitting; image input data are assumed to be ordered
  in x and are not explicitly sorted by <I>curfit</I>.
  <P>
  If the input is from a list the user may specify a set of weights,
  <B>weighting</B> = user or a set of errors, <B>weighting</B> =
  instrumental. An additional weighting option <B>weighting</B> = statistical
  can be used for both list and image data. The default is <B>weighting</B> =
  uniform.
  <P>
  When <B>interactive</B> = yes, the curve is plotted and cursor commands allow
  for interactive examining and adjustment of the fit. 
  The full range of interactive cursor commands is available
  including those for changing the function type, order, and rejection criteria,
  and examining the residuals.
  <P>
  The final fit parameters are written to STDOUT with the
  format controlled by parameters <B>verbose</B> and <B>listdata</B>.
  By default, the function type, order, and resulting chi-square are 
  printed as well as the coefficients and their standard deviations.  
  If <B>verbose</B> is set to yes, a list of X, Y_calculated, Y_input,
  and W_input is also printed.
  If <B>listdata</B> is set to yes, the only printed output will
  be a listing of X, Yc, Y and W. This provides a list suitable as input to
  <B>graph</B> or any other list oriented utility.  Setting <B>listdata</B> 
  to yes overrides the verbose option.
  <P>
  When <B>power</B> = yes, the coefficients are converted to power series
  coefficients of the form a0 + a1*X + a2*X**2 +a3*X**3 ....
  Only legendre and chebyshev coefficients are converted; a conversion
  of spline coefficients is meaningless.  Also, errors in the coefficients
  are not converted.
  <P>
  The user has a choice of single or double precision calculations.  Generally
  double precisions is used since the calculation time is only slightly
  longer.  The single precision calculation is used in many other tasks
  which do many fits.  This task provides a test tool to compare the
  results between the two levels of precision.
